"""Conversations with God Book 1 is the single most extraordinary book I have ever read!!!It totally changed my life. I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking emotional and spiritual growth, freedom and empowerment. This book did wonders for my relationship with God, myself and everyone around me. I approach living differently, I enjoy life more.  I have had a copy of this book since it was first published (1997)? and I still turn to it again and again for spiritual enlightenment, upliftment and remembering.I love this book and I love Neale Walsch for his courage in writing it. Unbelievable! A MUST READ!!!""

Listen to what Bill gates says about the future of technology in your life - the past would indicate he knows what he's talking about.""

In fact, it really sucked.The only reason I'm giving the book five stars is because I like the fact that the author is willing to try new things.

"""I got this in pink and white for a slender 2 year old. It is a little on the loose side, but it does stay on. While my little girl is a bit of a tomboy, as she is overshadowed by 5 older brothers, she does enjoy wearing this over her jeggings and running around and playing. Her playdates, two who are closer to 3, are madly in love with the tutus--it's a good thing we only have one of them at a time. I think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch, but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has. The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure. I have made my own tutus, but they never looked as nice or were so soft.""

"""I have been reading and re-reading Kahlil Gibran for 34 years now. The Prophet is my favorite book of all time. It touches a piece of the spirit within all of us that is not connected to any particular religion yet speaks from - and to - all of them. The Prophet is masterfully insightful, poignant, and timeless. I gave a copy to each of my grown sons and hope they find as much insight in it as I have all these years. In fact, I chose the essay on children to read during the Unity Candle ceremony at my son's wedding. It was a beautiful, perfect passage for such a powerful moment!

"""Anything I've read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.""

"""I read this book at least once a year and every year I gain new insight from it. This book changed my life and I hope it does that same for you. If you're looking for something with poetic, beautifully grafted language than look no further.

It's a really short book and I assure you won't be disappointed.""

"
"""This is one of the first (literary) books I recall reading. My mother kept a collection of Gibran's works that she often read. I was curious to see what attracted her, so I looked into them too ( I was either eight or nine  at the time). I believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what I was being force-fed by nuns in  catechism class. Rereading Gibran now, I'm struck by the notion that Hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote Siddhartha. They  contain many of the same themes: No one else can guide you on your path.  You must select your own course. Preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen.  True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books. They may appear simplistic to the jaundiced eye, but they may also  provide the inspiration you need to see you through life's travails.""

It's quite amazing how much wisdom is packed into a relatively short book. Every page makes you think and reflect on your own life. I will definitely be going back and re-reading this again and again. I can tell it's one of those books that you'll find a new treasure or a deeper insight with every read. A spiritual classic and a must read for every Christian and spiritual/philisophical seeker trying to understand the depth, mystery, beauty and struggles of life.""

"""Intrinsically, this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author. While, personally, I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book, I did find it, simply a pleasure to read. Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany, the style of the book in its fluid manner, the parallel structure of the chapters, and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece, leave the reader, whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not, in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time. As, really, they probably have not, it really did not waste my time anyway; it only took a little over an hour to read (with breaks).""

"""I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this. I knew only that it was a well-regarded book, and that it was said to be full of wisdom.What I found was a story that was easy to read. There are few words per page, covering the sayings of a wise man as he speaks to those around him. There is a kind of poetry in the words, but not the kind that is difficult to understand. The insights were both familiar and refreshing. It made me reconsider my notions of all aspects of life, although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening.I bought the hardcover. It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters. Throughout the book are scattered drawings that Kahlil Gibran made. I like them. I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god. Gibran says, """"... the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks, than to the least of all the blades of grass.""""

"""I plan to buy 3 more copies from Amazon, for my departing son & distant friends.Last night, I made a mad dash to get a copy of this book, ten minutes before the book store closed; because I couldn't find my old one.  I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.  But don't be so easily deceived, because this book packs more useful information than any 50-pound college textbook, without the endless verbage of a 1,000 page Russian novel.It is small, the paper of good weight and quality (the ones I always purchase, at least), the print is big and the illustrations done by Mr. Gibran are simple yet humana and divinical.  The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.  I was first given this book by a friend, as a departing gift for a 7,000 land/sea voyage, back in 1983.I hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me.

"""I am alive like you, and I am standing beside you.Close your eyes and look around, you will see me in front of you.~Gibran's words on his EpitaphThe Prophet captures the teachings of Kahlil Gibran in a comforting story that succinctly touches on everyday topics like love, giving, joy, sorrow, freedom, pain, teaching, friendship and beauty. Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer """"dwell in the solitude of your heart"""" so they """"live in your lips.""""As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his """"ship arrives"""" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.""""Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?""""The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: """"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.""""Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as """"her young prophet.""""  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.""""But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night."""" ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review""

"""I picked up this book later in life after many family hardships befell me.  Rather than looking to religion or self help books an honest and humble friend read versus from this book to me.  Having loved poetry and free verse most of my life I was struck with vivid beauty in the simplicity of the words that graced my ears that night.  Kahlil Gibran in his day was renowned for his prose and how he carried it with the same simplicity that met my ear that night.  In his finest work he left an indelible mark on my soul, not just for his words but how his words and their importance can change to the reader throughout their life.  Regardless of religion, social preference or upbringing his words have the ability to stir the soul and to channel emotion to a strong degree.  Once a gift for my late mother in her dying days it remains not a pillar of strength but a pedestal on life.  Not a road map but a way to look at your surroundings when the path before you seems clouded.  It gives you not direction but focuses on finding a clearer path.  I've read several of Gibran's other works since then but this stands the test of time.  If I could ever call any writing a masterpiece, this would be it, for I still read it and still draw from it every time I pick it up.""

"""It is a true masterpiece in which almost every, if not every word counts.  I have read it over and over again, since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before I left for Berkeley to attend law school.  I have given copies to many friends, and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully.There is enormous wisdom in each chapter, especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings.  Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life, and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century.This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about.  Indeed, it can be picked up at any age, and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written.I urge anyone, who is thinking about buying it, to do so.  Just peruse a copy at a local bookstore or library, and you are apt to become enthralled.  It may take several readings to soak up its essence; and even after many years, I still find nuances and learn more each time I reread it.""

Work, marriage, love: each subject is treated with a short  essay that will challenge everything you have ever been taught. Gibran's  words also give comfort to the reader when ordinary counsel has left him  lost.  Each reader should re-read this book every 10 years. Although  Gibran's words never change, you have; it is like meeting up with an old  trusted friend...you are home.""

"""The Prophet Almustafa waits in the city of Orphalese for his ship to take him home.  For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.  The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times.  The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.Victoria Tarrani""

"""'The Moon of Gomrath' is the wild magical sequel to 'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen', set in Alderley Edge in Cheshire of the present day but harking back to the days of Middlearth. Both these stories have a very Tolkienish way about them, it is an interesting exercise to compare and contrast the characters as they are introduced. It is a pity that Garner's books, faring less well than 'The Hobbit', dropped off the literary radar in the 1980's, but with the benefit of Potter power they are now back in style with new artwork on the cover.Garner's special art is to take a basic swords-and-sorcery story and elevate it into a poetry-and-powers myth with gritty heroes and terrifying villains who hard to defeat and not always easy to spot. This story of Colin and Susan's second adventure is aimed at a slightly older audience than the Weirdstone, has Susan in the lead role, and has more depth and menace along with some sly humour. The Morrigan is back, not yet at the height of her powers, but ready for revenge. The elves are suffering and dying from the pollution caused by Man: they must retreat to cleaner, remoter places. The battles in magic and swordplay are more deadly and more personal and more realistic. The havoc and hard pace of war are felt in the prose, which is breathless and a little wild itself. The wizard Cadellin takes more of a back seat in this adventure but he does explain (in chapter four) why the coming of the 'Age of Reason' and industrialism was more of a coming of the age of Materialism and a retreat from Reason. Hence the great rift between our Man's world of material values, and the worlds of magic and the life of the spiritual values.Now as every parent knows, children's books have the power of forming the child's mind. (True even in the age of film and video, as books are both more personal and make mind-expanding demands on the imagination. Films just fill up whatever space is in your head, they do not create it. Books are not just good for you, they are more fun.) So with magical adventures being very much back in style now is a good time to get the various authors into some sort of order. So, without going back to the ancient Greeks, where does Alan Garner fit in? We can easily go back a century or so: F. Anstey (Vice Versa), George MacDonald (Princess and Curdie stories), and E. Nesbit (House of Arden, etc), Tolkien (Hobbit, Farmer Giles of Ham), C.S. Lewis (Narnia, the land of youth), Ursula K. LeGuin (Earthsea), and Alan Garner. And, as Rowling's ghost Peeves puts it, 'Wee Potty Potter', brings us up to date.So there are two main routes to magic. Anstey, MacDonald, Nesbit, Garner, and Rowling write a story that exercises magic in this world, and the two things collide with exciting degrees of chaos and depth. The results are serious or hilarious, or both. Garner manages to interface the two worlds with superior art. But a higher priced ticket will take you to a whole new world. Tolkien, Lewis, and LeGuin create whole worlds of their own and people it with new peoples - a fully magical world. The magic is integrated, truly part of the fabric of that world, not just added to make it fizz. One you are in, you belong there for a while. You return and your own world is now a little more magical. The whole range of literary forms is now possible, even super-possible as we no longer rely on supposed 'realism' to make the effects. They go beyond just making a magical talisman or two (some brilliantly done, others less so), and seeing 'what happens'. They make new countries and skies, new kingdoms and peoples, new languages and rules. Ultimately they are the suns and the others are the moons.""

"""Written as a """"play for voices"""" for the BBC, this historic audiotape features the all-Welsh cast of the original BBC production from 1954. Richard Burton is the First Voice, which connects all the characters, played by twenty-eight men, women, and children. With perfect diction and the sense of character which only a great actor can convey, Burton rolls his R's, modulates his voice in pitch and intensity, and makes Thomas's poetry come fully alive--full of alliteration and various kinds of rhyme, with nouns and adjectives used as verbs to convey action and sense impressions simultaneously, and always a wry humor and honesty of feeling.Depicting one full day in the life of a small town in Wales, Thomas shows its motley residents as they awaken, perform their daily tasks, socialize, gossip, and daydream about the past that might have been and the future that may yet hold hope. When night falls and the residents retire, their losses and disappointments, along with their escapes into dreams, are given voice and poignancy. Polly Garter, with her numerous children by numerous fathers, dreams of Willie, a very small man who was the love of her life. Captain Cat, the blind bell-ringer, thinks of all the sailors he knew who died at sea. Mr. Pugh dreams of poisoning his wife, and young Gwenny, who has extorted pennies from the little boys who do NOT want to kiss her, plans for the next day and more pennies.The sound effects provide context for the drama without overpowering the narrative--a cock's crow, the clip-clop of horses, the bark of dogs, footsteps, the sea, bell buoys--and simple songs add to the realism and the sense of character and place. A mournful tune performed by Polly Garter in a minor key, as she remembers Willie and compares him to her other lovers, is beautifully sung by Diana Maddox, her clear, bell-like voice and almost palpable sadness making her one of the most memorable of the characters. A humorous children's singing game, sung by local school children, gives added realism, and little Gwenny's song to three very young boys is delightfully cheeky. Both enchanting and historically important, this memorable recording is worth seeking through Used sites or through amazon.co.uk--the best recording ever made of this wonderful """"play for voices.""""

"""Any self confessed 'woe is me'-style drama queen will be inconsolable if they ever stumble across Hardy's story about the ultimate victim.  Tess is used and abused by almost every other character in the book and remains unshakeably self righteous throughout. (well almost)  Without giving too  much away, strong irony is cleverly used here and there, Hardy's always  wonderful theme-setting descriptive skills shine as usual and the character  studies are brilliant.  Every main person in the book has one surprise or  other up their sleeve.  All in all, it's a classic tragedy...""

"""This is a review for both the Hard cover book and the audio Casette.I read this 10 years ago, as the second book following the Zahn Trilogy.  By comparison it was natural to feel disappointed.  But over the years, listening to it several times on audio cassette it has grown on me.  The question you are asking, with so many SW books to select from should you read this one?  Yes.Luke falls in love.  The characters here appear in the Corellian Trilogy.  Bakura and Biotechnology used by the Ssi Ruuk is revisited in the ill intentioned NJO series.  Though it didn't seem to fit when I first read the book, the story here does fit nicely with the entire Expanded Universe.On the timeline I have this one at year 4.5 ANH.  The story takes place right after the battle at Endor in ROTJ.  Ben appears and tells Luke to go to Bakura.  Luke, at age 20 is in command and can only assemble a small force after the devastation of the battle they have just fought.  Naturally the Falcon, Han, Leia and Chewy are available to assist.The point of the plot is for the Rebels to help the Imperial garrison on Bakura defend against an invasion that is coming from the unknown regions.  The invaders are Large Reptilian creatures that, when they speak sound like flutes playing.  They use entechment to take the essence of sentient beings and place that essence inside their machines to run those machines.This is a book I recommend reading if you are now deciding to read the stories written for the classic era which starts with the Han Solo trilogy and ends with the Zahn Duology and the Dark Horse comic Union.  Fortunately, at this writing, Amazon.com had both new and used audio cassettes and paperbacks for sale.Audio Casette.  This is an abridged version that can be listened to in about 2  hours.  Anthony Heald is the reader and he is the best.  I recommend all the Bantam Audio books for star wars.  They do a great job presenting the books with music and sound effects.""

"""A reading of this book resembles a leafing through an album of old photographs dedicated to some unknown man named George Hardy. Each of the three narrators, who were once connected and loved him (though in different  manner and degree), shows two pictures and tells their prehistories. The  image of Master Georgie as a respectable, decent man turns into a central  figure of such a weird sexual and family conundrum that it will take some  time to perceive; an affectionate son turns into a frigid father and lover;  a drunkard into a brave surgeon of the English army during the Crimean War;  etc. The book ends in horrible bloody scenes of the senseless war carnage.  Ms Beryl Bainbridge does not give an opportunity for George Hardy to speak,  so we close the book but still do not understand who and what was George  and why these three persons were so devoted to him. Just as in a real life:  people come and go, we think we know them, but we usually know only their  external appearance, and their essence remains a mystery...""

"""Geroge Hardy, a surgeon and amateur photographer, discovers his father dead in the bed of another woman and hastens to bring the body home before his mother learns of it.  Three people help with this task, and their lives are irrevocaly changed because of it.The story is told through the eyes of those three people close to Master Georige.  The first is Myrtle, a young orphan who is accepted and raised by the Hardy family.  She immediately falls in love with Georgie, a love that will carry her from the streets of Liverpool to the battlefields of the Crimean War.  Next is Pompey Jones, a young street boy who helps move the body of George's father and then discovers George's passion for young men.  The last is Dr. Potter, a family friend who follows George all the way to the Battle of Inkermann, never understanding George's aversion to women or why he wants to attach himself to a unit during the awful war.  Through their eyes, we watch George change from a young doctor in England dealing with his father's troublesome death to the hardened field doctor trying to save lives during a time of war.This is a fantastic historical novel, with some of the most descriptive war scenes I've read in quite some time.  Bainbridge makes you feel the confusion, fear and dread that the soldiers faced both due to battle and due to disease.  At the same time, she shows how one life can effect others, either for better or for worse.  A highly engrossing novel.""
"
"""Perhaps I read without sufficient attention - I didn't initially realise that the narrator was changing persona in different chapters. There were subtle references to homosexuality mixed in with the war theme, so subtle that I had to re-read this short novel to sort everything out. However, I think Beryl Bainbridge has a masterly technique, and the ending really underlined the poignant irony of the whole story and its themes.  A very highly regarded writer, I shall read more of her novels. This was a good, provoking start.""

"""&quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; is vintage Tolkien encapsulated. Ham is a farmer who owns a cowardly dog named Gorm. The two of them set out to dispose of a dragon named Chrysophylax who is terrorizing the shire. They do defeat Chrysophylax, but how? Well, you have to listen to Sir Derek  Jacobi (best known in the USA as the stammering Emperor Claudius in the  Masterpiece Theatre series of the '70s; also as Brother Cadfael in The  Cadfael Mysteries) read you the story, as he does with the same elegance he  brings to all his performances. Sir Derek is a true master of the spoken  word. The combination of a writer like Professor Tolkien and a reader like  Sir Derek is truly rare and wonderful.

For example, (and I'm paraphrasing) """"The pawns are foot soldiers, marching up one by one, and can stubbornly block others from advancing"""".In short, the analogy to soldiers in war is what my son likes so much about the book.  He gets to attack me and strategize about it.  He is given freedom among a few rules (you can move whereever you want but only diagonally, in the case of the bishop).  I was amazed at how fast he was strategizing several moves ahead.

"""Clarence Larkin was ahead of his day in that he wrote about the Feasts of the Lord and wrote about the prophetic significance of each of these Feast Days. The Feast Days are mentioned in scripture to be kept by Israel forever. Each of these days have significance in God's plan of salvation for Israel and for the world.He also says Christ was crucified on 30 AD. Most churches use 31 or 33 AD because they don't understand that Christ, according to Daniel 9, was to be crucified in the middle of the week. That would be a Wednesday. If you were look at a Hebrew calendar for 30 AD you would see that Nisan 14 (Passover) fell on a Wednesday that year. The disciples were trying to bury Christ before the holy day (1st Day of Unleavened Bread) that happened to follow Passover. Thus they buried him as Wednesday was coming to an end at sunset. They buried him as Wednesday was coming to an end near sunset. 3 days and 3 nights later was Saturday, The Sabbath Day, as it was about to come to an end at sunset. That is when Christ rose. He rose on Sabbath, just before Sunday was about to begin. Christ rose on Sabbath, and not on Sunday. Christ is Lord of the Sabbath Day, as He said in scripture. The Lord's Day is Sabbath, not Sunday. God blessed the 7th Day in Scripture, and made it holy. Man cannot make Sunday holy. Man has no authority to change God's blessed day to Sunday. Sunday anciently was a day when people worshipped the Sun. God made heaven and earth in 7 days according to Genesis, and blessed the 7th Day, and rested from His work. This is His creation. He, as Creator, has every right to tell man when He wants us to worship Him as a community. That is the 7th Day Sabbath Day. John 1 tells us that Christ is the Word, and it was the Word that was with God and the Word was God. Thus Christ created the Sabbath day, and pronounced it holy, and also called Himself the Lord of the Sabbath. Man is wrong to pronounce Sunday the Lord's Day when it never was. Christ said that He was Lord of the SABBATH. He still is. Sabbath is the Lord's Day, and always has been.Study the Feasts of the Lord. The Sabbath is mentioned as one of those feast days. And, notice, these day are called by God THE FEASTS OF THE LORD, not the Feasts of the Jews! Also notice that in Geneses, the 7th Day was created for man (as Christ also said). Adam and Eve were present, but no Jew existed at that time.  THE FEAST DAYS OF GOD ARE FOR MAN, made to reveal the plan of God as revealed in His Holy Calendar. Study about the Feast Days and see what Clarence Larkin says of the significance of each of these Feast Days of the Lord in his superb book!""

"""It was dark and I was lost driving home. I tried to take a shortcut across the Staffordshire Moorlands. Something said I should turn left to cross the ridge to the next valley. I climbed a hill, then silhouetted against the moonlit sky was a shape I knew from this book jacket: Mow Cop. I had to leave the car and venture on foot into the gloom, stomach turning, mouth dry. The point of Red Shift is, perhaps, that our destiny is in some part the essence of the soil under our feet. This book succeeds so well in implanting this feeling that words were not needed to create in me the emotion of meeting Mow Cop that night.""

"""This is an excellent overview of the development of castle architecture and fortifications technology from the dark ages through the wide adoption of gunpowder. The historical narrative is that of English politics, and all the castles described are located within England and Wales, but the general story will be of interest to any medievalist. Sancha's peculiar (in the sense that I've never seen anyone else do it) device is placing drawings atop photographs of existing buildings. Her reconstructions of now-ruined architecture and  introductions of people into the pictures effectively draw her readers into the world she wishes to portray.""

"""This sequel to When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit jumps from age 12 when Pink Rabbit concluded to age 15. Anna and her family are coping, at times quite desperately, as refugees in London as war finally breaks out for England and then the U.S.  This continuation of a young girl's coming of age  in the midst of Hitler's attack on Europe, illustrates the hardships that Jews were confronted with who escaped Hitler's final solution. Since Anna's family were Germans, even though they would have been annihilated by the Third Reich, they were not allowed employment and other essential means for survival. How they survive, and Anna's and Max's (her older brother) coming of age in such conditions, are told, miraculously, without bitterness. I am now reading the final volume of Anna's story, A Small Person Far Away.""

"""This has to be the best book Robin Jarvis has ever written. A fascinating look at the Elizabethan period as a whole and key figures within that time as well as a marvellous fantasy novel. The main character is an alien from another world, but few aliens are easier to identify with. He is seemingly perfect and wins the adoration of the villagers he meets but deep down is flawed and faulted. Adam o' the Cogs, the novels main child character, is also well drawn, being a welcome change from the standard 'cipher' characters of young adult fiction. The supporting cast is odd, likeable and occasionally dislikable. As usual Robin Jarvis illustrates himself and the quality of the drawing is even higher than usual.An ultra-recommended read.""

"""For anyone who is familiar with the Montreux clinic this book proves to be a very interesting read. As an anorexic I remember seeing Peggy-Claude Pierre, (Clinic's director), on various television programs.(Some of which included: dateline, 20/20, Oprah, Maury Povich, Good Morning America). She was said to be """"an angel"""", trying to save children that were otherwise doomed to certain death. In 1997 struggling in the hospital I remember longing to be at her clinic. My doctor doubted that she was as great as she was made out to be, but I wrote it off as jealousy. Anyone who is familiar with eating disorders know that the causes are vast and often complex.This book tells about how she started off with very good intentions, but somehow became too money hungry along the way. She did not have the least amount of knowledge as to how to run a clinic of this nature, nor did she bother to provide adequate staff. The patients, weakened and vulnerable, were in so many ways as much victims to her, as they were to their eating disorders.This novel proves that there is no easy cure.""

The familiar characters are here in a slightly different setting, though I think his books with Jim Chee or Joe Leaphorn are stronger than those with both characters.

The plot is clever, and reprises Hillerman's themes of corrupt Easterners and Byzantine law enforcement agencies.

Her Yeti encounter starts off a little frightening but Peg soon turns the monster into a teddy bear and her fun doubles as he joins her on the trip back home.

Reid works in Plastoscene 2D sculptures that are intricate and detailed.  One can feel the texture and almost see the images coming off the page.

"""This is my surprise book of the year. It was a gift, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it's turned into a real winner.Spanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI, we follow the life of Grania, a child/woman who became deaf following scarlet fever. From a loving middle-class family, she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children, grew into a self-sufficient young woman, became a nurse, and married a hearing man, Jim. He went off to war, as did her childhood friend and brother-in-law, Kenan. Improbably for that Great War, both men returned - but in very different conditions.Divided into several parts, the early chapters are Grania's education, learning to live as a deaf person in the world of the hearing. The next part is Jim's story of his war experience.Then comes Grania's ultimately successful efforts to return the power of speech to her mute and traumatized childhood friend. And finally the resolution of all the stories.This book grows on you. One of the boldest risks author Itani took was to try (successfully) to convey Grania's silent world to readers, and to imitate the understanding of sign language as well as lip reading for those of us unfamiliar with the Deaf World.It's a stunning and powerful book, showing the power of Story to convey love, union, and understanding - and ultimately, joy.""
"
"""The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else.  Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the """"abnormal"""".  The young, autistic Christopher in """"Curious Incident"""" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?Grania, who would have been """"Grainne"""" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania """"blend in"""" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a """"Deaf School"""".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]""

"""How much pain and tragedy can one person absorb?  How do such experiences change us?  This is the riveting story of a war correspondent who has seen recent history up close and way too personal, his friends who have dealt with their own measure of violence, and an exiled Lebanese family he befriends.  These are people whose personal suffering forces them to grapple with responsibility in new and different ways.  Set in Paris, where the author has lived, and whose neighborhoods and changing immigrant face are vividly portrayed, the novel is finely written.  Some passages, even when they are describing impossibly difficult issues, are extraordinary.""

"""River City is a long, rambling tale that manages against all odds to entertainingly combine a murder investigation which begins in 1955 with a history of Montreal, beginning with the arrival of Jacques Cartier to its shores in 1535. The link between the two events is a jewel-encrusted dagger which is given to Cartier by a tribe of local natives. Some believe it has mystical powers, others are willing to kill for it because of its incredible value. Farrow gives readers an action-filled Montreal history lesson, following the """"Cartier Dagger"""" as it's passed down through the ages, telling the tale of the establishment of a settlement by French explorers, the city which grew in its place, the wars against the natives and the British, and so on. In the more """"modern"""" era, from the Rocket Richard hockey riot in 1955, through the Quiet Revolution which signaled the awakening of French nationalism in Quebec, up to the bombings and kidnappings of the October crisis in the early 1970s, Detective &Eacute;mile Cinq-Mars doggedly searches for the people who murdered a local hood and may have stolen the dagger. Historical characters mix with Montreal's police force and underworld in a story which by all rights should be awkward and impossible to follow. It is, instead, a fascinating look back at what went into the founding and creation of Montreal, the constant linguistic tensions between English and French, and the political manipulation that led to the body of a man found with a priceless relic piercing his heart on the night local hockey fans rampaged through the city streets to protest the suspension of their legendary hero, Maurice Rocket Richard. Farrow has skillfully written a great story for fans of murder mysteries as well as historical fiction.""

We've seen the father-son relationship theme explored in novels and movies such as BIG FISH and certainly BARK OF THE DOGWOOD explored not only that, but the theme of religion and history as well.  But this new novel takes things a step further. I absolutely adored this novel. When John Ames tells the story of his family he makes his abolitionist preacher grandfather come alive and makes the reader a part of his history. Ames' voice read so true that I constantly had to remind myself that this was fiction. I had to stop reading to ruminate on both Robinson's perfectly selected words and on what they conveyed. I felt like Robinson had distilled the entire Old Testament into one psalm of love and grace. VERY insightful and full of hidden meaning (if you look for it), GILEAD deserves its place among the bestsellers.""

"""As I write this I have not finished reading the novel yet I can already tell that it should be the novel of the decade. When I was at Rice University in the 1970s things were not as bad as they are at Charlotte's fictional (and current) DuPont, but you could see the present day coming. Humans have difficulty achieving balance, and therefore it only stands to reason that once banality becomes acceptable it will be pursued to its logical end. &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot; makes it pretty clear that the logical end of our banal culture is not far off, and it makes you wonder what the aftermath will be like. &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot; is not just a scathing attack on collegiate culture, but on broader American culture as well (after all the super hoops players in the novel have FANS), and must rank alongside the great Billy Wilder Films &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and &quot;The Big Carnival&quot; as a a cultural critique.""

"""Finally I have answers as to how so many doctors had so many different diagnoses and treatments for the same set of symptoms.'Prescription for Excellence' is a must read for anyone caught up in the health care system. Though Rachlis doesn't set out to reveal the influences on our doctors that make them 'say and do' the things they 'say and do' this is one of his unintentional achievements - a significant contribution to empowering the patient in their own care.In this book we quickly understand how the 'fee-for-service' penalizes doctors who spend time with patients - impacting listening, attitude, diagnosis and treatment. We rapidly appreciate the physician's lack of access to other professionals and their non-drug therapies - a void eagerly filled by pharmaceutical companies who often establish relationships with doctors before they even leave medical school! And we recognize the seemingly endless waiting lists for an array of diagnostic procedures. With a grasp of the many influences behind a diagnosis we can become participants in our own care.The real goal behind 'Prescription for Excellence' is to reveal a path to improved health care through the nurturing of innovative programs, models and techniques. Like any system, our health care system is &quot;perfectly designed to get the outcomes it produces&quot; and while we tend to focus on privatization or increased funding as a source of improvement Rachlis explores an alternative. Many programs in Canada, the US and Europe have succeeded in creating service improvements that channel non-hospital care away from hospitals - thereby reducing costs. Cultivating innovation and weeding out the obstacles to its growth may encourage these programs to grow beyond the conditions required for germination.We may not all share Rachlis confidence in health care teams or his optimism for call centers, but overall there is something for everyone and understanding the pitfalls and strengths of the system is the first step to turning it to our advantage.Angela HobbsAuthor of 'The Sick House Survival Guide; Simple Steps to Healthier Homes.'""

"""Granatstein hits most of the right targets when assigning blame for the neglect, bordering on outright sabotage, of the Canadian military.Pearson-era Defence Minister Paul Hellyer's bizarre unification experiment gets (almost) the scathing criticism it deserves, as does Trudeau's neglect of the military. And the morale-sapping myth of Canada as a nation of """"peacekeepers"""" is exposed in all its fraudulent glory.But Granatstein, like many of his opponents on the left, goes on to make that classic Canadian mistake of confusing a strong defence posture with greater continental integration. Make the military bigger, he says, while at the same time start cooperating more closely with Washington.Granatstein seems not to consider the possibility that Canada needs a stronger military to safeguard Canadian interests abroad and sovereignty at home on its own terms, rather than to blindly support U.S. foreign policy. His critique of Jean Chretien for keeping Canada out of the U.S.-led blunder in Iraq, for example, now looks particularly ill-chosen in retrospect.While sharing Granatstein's disgust at the damage and humiliation that politicians and bureaucrats have forced on Canada's military, one still can't help but wonder whether he really wants to save our military and restore its pride, or just set up a local recruiting depot for the U.S. military. Even most of the new equipment he suggests acquiring comes from the United States, with very little from Europe or Britain.Nevertheless, this is a book that every Canadian should read. And let's hope Canada's army stays Canadian, complete with the regimental system, """"leftenants"""" and a chain of command that ultimately stops in Canada. Or we could add Jack Granatstein to the list of those who helped kill Canada's military.""

"""A book of short stories verging on memoir, sorties weaved together with reoccuring characters, great read. Book took a bit long to get here, but was worth it.""

"Really liking this book.Can hardly put it down but have limited reading time.never saw the movie but not sure it could do the book justice

"""If you haven't read this book, you should definitely pick it up! It's definitely on the top 10 of my list! It is a must read for everyone. I loved how Jacob found an opportunity in the mist of his grieving over his parents' death.  He completely turned his life around for the better.  This book was not only a love story for me, but it was a book of adventure.  It had me sitting on the edge of my seat a few times during my read.  I like how the book takes you back to Jacob's past & present.  The ending of the book was completely unexpected for me.  I did not see it coming, but it's where Jacob belongs.  I think you will have just as much fun reading this as I did.  I couldn't put the book down!!""

"""As I child, I thought there couldn't be anything cooler than being a lion tamer or a trapeze artist. I dreamed about their magic lives.  When I heard about Sara Gruen's book I knew I had to read it and I wasn't disappointed.  It is an amazing story about life in a travelling circus but more importantly about the way we treat others and how that kindness can return to us in many different forms.The book begs to be discussed.  Shortly after finishing it, I happened to meet a modern-day travelling circus performer at the salon where I get my hair styled.  She said that the book was completely accurate and that even though conditions have changed somewhat over the years, the roles of the performers and the """"roustabouts"""" is pretty much the same.  Life in a circus is truly amazing and much more multi-layered than it appears in the big top.Congratulations to Sara Gruen for filling the book with accurate details and appealing photographs; charming anecdotes; and for an overall a fascinating read.""
"
"This is by far one of the best books I`ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Once I started I couldn`t stop reading. The story is just so well written and it is the perfect combination of humor and heartbreak. There is not a thing about this book that I don`t love. There were parts that made me laugh out loud and there were parts that had me reaching for the kleenex box. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.

"""This is really a fun read. The story is interesting, the writing flows easily, the characters are real and believable, and even though I thought a story about a circus during the depression era might be depressing, it was extremely interesting.

The love story captivated me, and it is not really something you read about every day (the circus), which made it even more interesting.I would have given it 5 stars if I was more captivated when Jacob first joined the circus... even so, I definitely recommend this book!""

"""**Spoiler Alert! Do not read this if you haven't read the book*  I haven't seen the movie yet, but the book left me confused at the end.  Jacob was so loyal to Camel, and Walter.  Why didn't he go back to search for them?  This should have been touched on in the book.  He eluded to going back.  Maybe he resigned to the fact they were most likely dead, but I don't see Jacob just leaving their bodies there, not without at least trying to find them to give them a proper burial.  I didn't like that the author just dropped the subject of them being redlighted, when the fear of it was so much a part of the book.  Overall I really liked it, but that just bothers me!""
"
"Great book!  Love that it goes back and forth between the past and present.  Helps you understand what elderly people go through as they age.
"
"""A love story that makes you think about how the paths we choose, are actually chosen for us.  The book is a page-turner.  I could not put it down.  The story was so intense and the characters were so well developed that I felt like it was one man's life story.  I felt for everyone, even the antagonists, who drove and dominated the other players throughout the story.  Too many times flashback stories cause you to lose pace with the story, but this book drew the reader in so completely that the timeline became seamless.  I really identified with the frailty of youth as much as old age.  It's sad the way that generations place less and less value on the lives of the elderly because of the 'burden' old age creates.  The book helped me understand how, when we age and begin to lose the loved ones of our generation, that some of the resilience that that empowers us is also lost, even though it is not actually gone.  The aged need new sparks to keep the flames of life going and this story brought that ideal out in spectacular fashion.  I have read the book four times since I received it.  For those who love the circus from the inside are in for a shock, unless you have known the hard paces of life and can identify with doing what you need to do to survive because, well, there is nothing better.  I love the camaraderie as much as the separation of classes.  If you know of or lived through the depression, you can identify with much of the goings on when the circus came to town.  In the same vain, you get a sense of why the layout was what it was.  I personally remember the circus from the rubes perspective and can understand from the book much of the production that went into creating the spectacular that kept me enthralled until the next time the circus came to town, never knowing exactly when, just like the book, another adventure at the next jump.""

"""I got WATER FOR ELEPHANTS as a gift from my husband. When I opened it I said to myself, why on earth did he buy me this? I aked him what prompted him to chose it - he said because I've had a life long fascination with Freak Shows and they're part of the Circus. OK. Fair enough.If it hadn't been for him buying it for me I would have missed out on what has become my favorite piece of fiction I have ever read.I am in love with this book.This book is enchanting. The characters are, variously, loveable, hateworthy, pathetic, nasty and dastardly.Sara Gruen knows her characters so well and writes them with such passion they seem real. You will feel that you know them too. And the writing is so vivid you will feel like you're standing ring-side. Inhale deeply - can you smell the cotton candy?And the ending of this book is the most perfect, satisfying ending I have ever, ever read.I'm not going to pigeon-hole it with category or genre and risk putting some people off...like me.There are some Book Club talking points at the end of the paperback version and one such talking point is to discuss the book's 'pathetic glamour.' That is a perfect descriptor. The circus fakes its glamour and its glitz; the daily lives of the crews who work it are anything but, and at times are brutal, harrowing, even.I've learned a valuable lesson from this book - what I want as a reader is just writing that takes my breath away. I got that from WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.""

"""I normally do not review books so that I don't spoil the read,l but I must say that this is a beautiful, touching, and emotional novel. Great!""
"
"An excellent novel that kept me reading for hours! From the beginning hook all I wanted to do was find out what happened and even when I did I just continued going! A wonderfully written novel that not only chronicles circuses in the 1920's but it also captures the great depression and the prohibition so well. Just an all around excellent book that I could not put down. Definitely worth the money.

"""Book DescriptionAs a young man, Jacob Jankowski was tossed by Fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm. We guarantee you will not be able to put this one down!""
"
"Quick and exciting read.  I was mesmerized by the whole circus atmosphere that was well crafted and the flashing forward and back kept me reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open.
"
"""This is not really a particularly intellectual book, or the kind that will have you pondering but it will hold your interest and enthrall you; which makes it a perfect holiday read. It is not only a fantastic love story but is a seemingly accurate depiction of circus life during Great Depression (so you still get to learn things after all)and has enough plot to hold your interest but not so much as to seem over engineered. There is even a lesson about how we should treat old people.A good read""
"
"""The book was received in perfecty shape and was received in a timely manner.  We haven't read the book yet, but we expect it to be similar to the movie.""
"
"""Water for Elephants has a quality so many modern novels are lacking, and that is an sense of enchantment. So many novels these days take you to a place you would really rather not be, but even the scruffy world of the down-and-out traveling circus is full of mystery and--dare I say it--soul. Love doesn't hurt, either. My 84-year-old mother dislikes modern novels (too much bad language) but she loved this one.""
"
"""As someone who's never been to or interested in the circus, this book grabbed my attention almost immediately, and from then on, I couldn't put it down. Gruen creates real, well-developed, believable characters - some who you love to hate, and some you just love to love. She shows a real affinity for and love of animals through her characters, which makes so many of them that more enjoyable. If you're an animal lover, you will enjoy this story hands down. Parts of it will make you cry, some will make you laugh, and many more will make you smile. Surprisingly, the interaction between Jacob and Rosemary are some of my favorite moments, and the ending is one that I never saw coming (this is no Nicholas Sparks novel, my friends). All in all, """"Water for Elephants"""" is a fantastic story that I was glued to from the moment I picked it up.""

"""I usually read books which are either non-fiction or based on true events or people. This book swept me off my feet. I am madly in love with the animals and the love between Jacob and Marlena. I really identify with Marlena, in terms of her up- bringing and how her life changed at a young age. Even more so, Jacob's life is that of a true hero and humanitarian. I would have loved him as much as Marlena did.Its colorful the picture is so well painted and ever changing- wont leave you saying.... new? when is the action gonna happen. No screen writer should ever touch this and ruin it.""

"
"""I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end.""

"Great read I cant wait for this to be a movie. It mde me laugh and cry I didnt want it to end but what a wonderful ending it was!!
"
"""I found """"Water for Elephants"""" extremely entertaining, despite never seeing a circus or having any interest in the subject.  The backdrop is the 1930's, and the book throws you into the era of carnivals, Prohibition, and the Great Depression.  You're led by slums with hobos, and everyone is dying for regular pay and something to eat.The story bounces back and forth between a man living out his twilight years in a nursing home, and his 23-year-old self... where circumstances find him joining a circus.  Life revolves around the train for these guys - they always travel in cramped space with all kinds of memorable characters.There are some great anecdotes so strange you'd think they were true.  My favorite was Rosie the bull elephant sneaking lemonade by pulling her stake out of the ground, and then being smart enough to replace it to avoid getting caught.The author respects the reader enough to let him figure out what's happening from contextual clues.  For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed.  You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz).  Note that there are some graphic sexual encounters and profanity that make this mature with a capital """"M"""" - don't give it to anyone younger than a high school kid.""

"Love the details in this book and the emotions.  Could picture all the characters and their situations.  Liked the ending also.

Another book not to be missed is The Help.""
"
"I loved this book. I had seen the movie a while back and loved it. A friend of mine recommended the book and said it was much better than the movie. She was right. Gruen does a great job of developing the characters and you feel connected and part of the story.  I'm glad I finally read it.

"This novel tells the story of a man who is now old and struggling with health problems. A carnival comes to town and he remembers the amazing life he once had. I loved the ending the most and hated when characters died. The story itself was believable and the characters complex. This book is not for children and can leave you quite depressed at certain points. Other than that [and that's more of an observation than a complaint] this is a solid read. If the characters didn't die this would've been a 5.

"This was an excellent book! I always love the books more but the movie was just as good! Very well researched and written...definitely one of the top books!

"""Water for Elephants was a great book! Loved the transition from young Jacob to old Jacob, the parallels between the circus and the circus that was the nursing home.

"""I was so pleasantly surprised when I read this.  Typically I feel like reading a New York Times Bestseller is kind of a crap shoot.  You're likely to end up with something interesting, but whether or not it's actually a good, well written book is another story.  Water For Elephants was wonderfully surprising in that it was everything I hope for in a novel: an interesting plot, well developed characters, compelling action, and a well researched background.  My only complaints with this novel are I felt that the periods spent with the elder Jacob were not developed as finely as they might have been and some of the story lines were tied up rather quickly (and without a real explanation).""
"
"""This unique story brings back a slice of the 1930s, the long gone circus world of the past, but not the usual bigtop action.  The main character is without giving away anything serves in a position that straddles the worlds of performer and worker and yet belongs to neither. There's madness, grinding poverty, tradgedy, revengeexcitement, bewilderment, surprises, and revelations, but I don't believe a review should be a book report, so trust me if you like suspense, tinged with the meaning of life itself, please do yourself the favor of reading this wonderful novel.  I wish I could erase my memories and do so afresh.  Jim.""
"
"I loved this audiobook. The story telling was magnetic and I connected very well with the old and the young Jacob. Highly recommend.
"
"""This marvelous book is the tale of getting old in America, with a tale about the circus in between.  I have a mother in assisted living so those chapters resonated with me. I see the other residents as they shuffle their tired old bodies from their room to the dining room to the couch and back to their rooms.  The story of Jacob in his later years, tells the story of so many people in their later years.  We are an aging society.  We are facing tough choices as we take care of our parents or we ourselves face living in a facility like the one Jacob found himself in.  The sad and tragic day when his own kids forgot to come take him to the circus is what so many elderly must experience each and every day.  Ms. Gruen was able to capture the story of circuses during the depression.  But for me, she touched my heat and soul with the story of older Jacob.""

"""I couldn't put this book down - an excellent story, easy read and fun! Now I can't wait to see the movie!!""
"
"""First of all, Sara Gruen tells a really good story. People and animals both have their moments. What most impresses me though is her ability to show the feelings and memories of an old man. Once old, we tend to forget that the old man in a nursing home was once a part of exciting and dangerous events.To me, the viewpoint and dialogue of Joseph at 90 (or 93) really makes this book.Give it a read.And now the point of the Audio review:  If you like the book then you will find the unabridged audio a real treat. The reader captures the characters and takes you right along. We have listened to the story twice and still appreciate the skill of the reader and the beauty of this book.""
"
"""I started reading """"Water for Elephants"""" on a Saturday night and before I knew it, I had read half the book in one sitting. Sara Gruen's protagonist Jacob Jankowski, carries you through the novel - both as a twenty-three year old who just walked out of his Vet exams and onto the Circus arena and as ninety-three year old man stuck in a nursing home. Gruen's flawless ability to capture Jacob's voice both as a young and old man are is one of the many strengths of her talents. The storyline, which is composed of coming-of-age, love and well a circus will draw you in and keep you till you eyes read over every last word.

"""I loved this book. On a recent trip to Japan, I dreaded the 14 hour flight. Water For Elephants was such a captivating story, it made the flight go faster! I loved how Sara combined a good mix of history with a story of love, tragedy and adversity. Anyone who loved going to the circus as a kid can relate to the thrill and the illusion that the circus brought us. Rarely do you read about the life of someone who lived with a traveling circus.""
"
"""A terrific page turner.  It gives a behind the scenes look at the not so glamorous life in a travelling circus, as told by a 90-year old's  memories from the Great Depression.  Gruen's simple, yet compelling writing mixes the present day character's experiences in a retirment home  with his life in the 1930's.  But when the reader sees life at the circus, you see it as it happened, not with editorial musings from an old man reminiscing.  The book has everything -- action, love, sex and what seems to be an accurate descpription of a place and time in which few people alive ever lived.""
"
"A wonderful story about a wonderful warm gentle human being through his words you see his life past and present  excellent book.

"Very well written.  A fascinating story about the circus folks of the 1930's.  This book will make you laugh and cry.
"
"""This is such a captivating narrative! I've read hundreds of books but very rarely does a story touch me the way this one did. I read the whole thing while on a very long flight to Europe and for the life of me, I couldn't put it down. Throughout the whole experience, I laughed and cried, then cried some more. Sarah Gruen is a talented storyteller-the way she is able to give layers to her characters and portray them in such a glamorous yet dark way is so refreshing. The plot fulfills the heart's desire for tragedy, adventure, survival, scandal, romance and humor. Tie it all in with a 1930's struggling circus backdrop and well; you've pretty much got the perfect novel. Judging by the number of times I've read this book (which is at least 3 times) I would say this it definitely in my top 5 favorite reads.""

"""This was a tremendously fun and interesting read... not to mention educational too. The whole travelling circus/sideshow thing has always fascinated me, so it was interesting to find a novel with that as it's backdrop. The characters felt very real and I found myself reading far past my bedtime because I wanted to see what was going to happen next.The only dissapointing part of the book to me was at the very end. I can see how some people like things to be tied up in a nice little bow, but to me it was so implausable that it almost ruined the whole reading experience.""

"""Jacob Jankowski is an old man now - either 90 or 93 years old - but his youthful memories of life as a veterinarian with the Benzini Bros Most Spectacular Show on Earth remain vivid, especially when a traveling circus camps just outside the grounds of his assisted living care facility. All those he cared about during his circus days: Marlena the bare-back rider, Rosie the elephant, Camel the roustabout, Walter the dwarf and Bobo the orangutan are dead now, but they glow with life in Jacob's memory.  It's true his memories are not always pleasant. His years with the circus were depression years for the country, with circuses failing on all sides. If you read this book you'll see a side of the circus you probably never imagined: its rigid caste system of performers vs working men, skipped paychecks, long days and longer nights, jealousy, madness and death. But you'll also find beauty, love and great kindness, especially to some remarkable animals.Oh, and the ending is quite wonderful if perhaps a bit fanciful. A grand book about the big top. Don't miss it.""

At 93 he resides in a nursing home, not his choice, but probably for the best.

Water for Elephants tells the story of how Jacob lost everything while finishing his final year at Cornell Veterinary School and joined the traveling circus.Gruen tells the story in two parts, going back and forth from the past to the present time in a way that is easy to read and very entertaining.  Her extensive research into traveling circuses and elephants makes this a very good readThis is one of those books that once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down.  It has been on the NY Times Best Seller List for 76 weeks as of today and it is still ranks in Amazon's Top 100 after nearly two years since its publication.

"""Finally getting around to reading this book, I found a jewel.  Sara Gruen artfully converges the life in the Depression-era circus and life in a nursing home.  Both are superbly drawn.  Her vast research on traveling circus life is obvious; I learned a lot from this story. The fun, glory and despair of life under the big tent are detailed.  The despair of aging in the nursing home is heart-breaking.  I found the chacters suberbly drawn and the settings quite believable. This was a very engrossing book which I highly recommend.""

"""Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is one of those rare novels that will be read and re-read, discussed and enjoyed for many years, by old and young alike. Destined to be passed among family and friends and back again, until the tattered, timeworn pages resemble the books beloved central character and narrator.Jacob Jankowski had studied Veterinary Medicine and was days from exams when his parents were killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, he hopped a train, never intending to """"run away with the circus"""".... It was the midst of the depression and life was hard. Joining the Benzini Brothers Circus would change his life again. From town to town, day after day, set it up, tear it down-the freaks and geeks, midgets and clowns worked, ate, lived and often died together. The harsh conditions are made even more unbearable by the greedy manager and his insane animal trainer. Yet somehow, in the midst of despair, friendships and laughter persevered. Although much of the laughter was alcohol induced, during the height of the depression and prohibition, you took what you could get.The narrator's transition from the young circus vet, to the elderly, cantankerous nursing home resident, is a well-crafted, bi-lateral view that pulls the reader into this fictional world and never lets go. Whether in his twenties, admiring the beautiful equestrian performer, Marlena, and caring for the animals he loved-or in his nineties, complaining about the indignities of old age, the warm, quick wit comes through loud and clear. From the big top to the nursing facility Gruen's sharp, three-dimensional, fictionally fluid characters will have you laughing out loud one minute, mouth agape in disgust the next.Hurry, hurry, step right up, readers and book lovers everywhere. If you hunger for a reading experience chock full of every conceivable emotion, beautifully written and wholly engrossing, Water for Elephants is a wondrous world, where fact and fiction combine, delivering the most memorable and pleasurable hours, you will be spend with a book. Characters so sharply drawn and wrought with emotion that there nearly flow off the page.Armchair Interviews says: If you only read one book this summer, let this be it!""

"""WATER FOR ELEPHANTS by Sara GruenThis is a marvelous book that covers the two bookends of the long adventurous life of Jacob Jankowski, going back and forth from him as a ninety-plus-year old in an assisted living facility, to him thinking back to his days working on the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus that moved around the country in its own train.He is all alone in the nursing home, with most the employees viewing him as more trouble than he is worth, except for one wonderful nurse named Rosemary, who shows him respect and compassion, and is for all practical purposes his only friend at this point in his life. While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book. I will not spoil it for you, but you are certain to like and appreciate it.This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.Hey Joe (Jamaica Series)""

"""Although the main character is in a nursing home in his 90's, much of the book was about his experience in the Big Top TENT CIRCUS . If someone doesn't care for 4 letter cuss words--but it is just part of the flavor of the people in the BIG TOP. He dislikes being treated like a senile man by the nurses when he is a very clear minded man. I was glad to hear more about the Big TOP Circus that my father used to go see as a young boy.This is worth reading !My sister gave it to me and I bought a copy for my 30 year old son (a Nurse) and his wife who don't have a TV because they read aloud to each other.""

The book is set in the present day as well as the early 1930's.  It paints the picture of exactly what I would think a traveling circus would be during that time.

Animal lovers will have a tough time reading some parts of this book.  I love animals and it is often tough to learn how many animals were cared for, or not cared for.  You will love the people in the story, and at time you will be mad as hell at them.  I felt that I was on the train with Marlena and Jacob.  I felt their pain and joys.

"""This is a better book than I thought it would be.  It takes you back in time when things were simpler.  Or were they?  Sara Gruen has written a book that alternates between the nursing home that Jacob lives in and his memories of when he worked for the circus as an unlicensed veterinarian.I used to work in a couple of nursing homes as an LPN.  The hardest part was not having enough time to sit with the residents and visit with them.  There were a few residents I was able to get to know.  One lady I even brought to my home for supper.  We had such a great relationship.  So this book brought back many memories for me.Sara Gruen has written a book that holds your interest and you won't want to put it down.  I love this book.  There are some books I just won't give away and this is one of them.The behind the scenes look into circus life, especially during the depression and the problems that take place are quite interesting.  One never knew from one day to the next if they would have a job.  It was also very dangerous work. You also never knew who you could trust.  There were behind the scene plots and jealousy that one would kill for.The bond Jacob and Rosie have is priceless.  Jacob and Marlena's bond is great. Sara Gruen really knows how to bring a story together and finds a great way to end the story.  I think Jacob is still with the great circus in the sky.Rosie is a charactor unto herself.  She has a wonderful sense of humor.""

"Once in a great while a book comes along that is so good that you wish it would never end. Water for Elephants is one of those books.  I highly recommend it.  Sara Gruen is definitely a master story teller.
"
"""This is a gentle book that I found myself thinking about when I couldn't be reading it. Just as James Harriot could write about some pretty unseemly characters, there is compassion and understanding there so that you know the motivation and realize that the characters made the choices they did because they were the best choices available to them.(Excluding the method of Redlighting or throwing unwanted employees off of moving trains in the middle of the night!) I read it in three sittings.  It struck me how well the author captured what it must be like to be old.  She has the main character alternate between his present life in a nursing home and then flashes back to his circus days.  A review above talked about how the main character was the only one with compassion; this isn't true; there is a dwarf and his dog that are amazing characters; Rosemary, one of the nurses at the home and numerous others who are exquisitely crafted. Rosie the elephant who smiles just made me smile throughout. This book will be with me for a very long time;  I never reread books, but this one might just warrant another read.  It is the kind of book that while reading, every once in a while you just have to pause and absorb the beauty of the writing and the way an idea has been conveyed.  I've been recommending it to everyone I see, because again, it keeps creeping in to my thoughts.  Someone recommended it to me because something in our conversation reminded her of it.  It's that kind of book.""

Yes, the details about circus life were interesting, and the romance was gripping in a kind of 1930s way.  But there were a lot of things that didn't make sense to me (circuses are going broke right and left, but the star performers appear rich, wearing tuxedos and drinking champagne), and for my money the bad guys were too bad and the good guys too entirely good.  The minor characters (the little person, the hootch dancer, etc.) were more complete than the leads.It would make a heckuva film though - drama, chase scenes on the top of train cars, etc.I also confess that the audio version  may have added to my bad humor - there was one fellow playing the older narrator who was really superb, but the fellow reading the part of the young hero was whiny in the extreme (what did she see in him?.""

"""WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a sweeping story of nearly epic proportions that touches on the young, the old, and lost loves, all within one man's life.His name is Jacob Janowski, a grumbling old 93-year-old (or is it 90-year-old?) fart living in an old folks home. Enduring his final days with other old folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read. It also, surprisingly, has a ton of character depth, and not just for human characters but for the animals Jacob tends. Particularly that of Rosie the """"dumb as hammers"""" elephant that turns out to be much, much more than what she seems.The ending to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS was absolutely perfect, letting us know that even though the elderly can be crotchety, they serve a much greater purpose than to be wheeled around in chairs and told when, what and where to eat, drink, and think. Finding a home where one belongs is the toughest thing when people get older, and it was a fantastic ending for Jacob to """"go home"""" to when the final sentence gets read.""
"
"""Love love love this book. This book is so much more than I thought it would be. Its beautiful, exciting, eye opening, and intriguing. I fell in love with the story and its characters from the beginning. Favorite character of all?... Rosie for sure... yes the elephant. Shes innocent, smart, witty, out smarts her humans and seemingly has a wonderful personality. She is amazing. But of course this book is not just about an elephant. Its about love, hate, excitement, tyranny, rage, and some real good laughs. Definitely a book worth reading.""

"""I Bought this one on a whim as my favorite authors seemed to have dried up a little. I'm so glad I did, it's wonderful.Jacob Jankowski is 93 (hr thinks) and in an old folks home put out to pasture. He has an enthralling story inside him that many of us only wish we had. Dropping out of college and running away with the circus as a young man, his story unfolds as a true adventure.The circus of the 30's is the back drop for this wonderful yarn and we follow Jacob as he navigates his way around the people, the lore, the language and the pecking order. All the characters are colorful and each brings a dimension to the story that has the reader turning pages as fast as possible. I think I blew through this one in two days. I might have done it in one had I not had commitments I had to keep.The story is interspersed with up to date goings on at the old folks home the aged Jankowski is a resident of but, you can just tell his heart is still on the circus train of his youth.

"""Water for Elephants is an entertaining read that chronicles the life of Jacob, a circus' veterinarian (well, would have been if he would have taken his final exams). The story is told in alternating time periods, Jacob recounting his youth from the confines of an assisted living facility. After the horrific death of his parents during the Great Depression, Jacob drops out of school and begins working with the Benzini Brothers circus. He quickly discovers the dark secrets so well-hidden behind the cheerful, humorous faade of circus shows. While on the road Jacob grows up and learns a great deal about life """"out in the real world"""" while traveling with the circus, including lessons on friendship, trust, love and self-reliance.This novel is extremely plot driven and is not a literary challenge by any means. I appreciate the take on circus life; this isn't something that is commonly written about. It was still very enjoyable and interesting, and I would recommend it for all readers.""
"
"""Water for Elephants is the first adult novel I've read and it certainly didn't disappoint.The story starts off with ninety-three year old Jacob Jankowski recounting his life as a young man training at Cornell to be a veterinarian. He drops everything when his parents die and joins the circus.Jacob was a very easily liked character. I'd have to say the flash forwards were something I really enjoyed. Gruen's seamless writing between past and present is breathtaking. Reading the difference between an older Jacob as opposed to a young one was really intriguing. It was interesting to hear him describe how his body has aged from the vital, handsome young man he once was and how he sees himself as this decrepit old man now. It was so sad but quite hysterical at the same time.I didn't feel like I connected with Marlena too much. Yes, I liked her as a character, but I had a hard time seeing what Jacob thought was so special about her. A character I had a hard time deciding whether or not I liked, from the moment he was introduced, was August. In the beginning you want to like him when he's befriending Jacob, but when he starts slipping up and showing that he is really a very cruel man you immediately switch to despising him.Now Rosie... what can I say about Rosie? She is the cutest elephant ever! I love how Gruen wrote her with such a loveable personality. Well, really how she wrote most of the animals with such great characteristics. Bobo the monkey was also super adorable. Needless to say, something that I had a hard time with while reading this was the animal cruelty. A while back, I read an article from PETA on how elephants - most circus animals, really - are treated and it was just awful. So it was really hard reading it in gruesome detail. But hopefully, it'll make people realize how circus animals are treated so they can make a stand against it.Overall, Gruen has created a beautifully written novel. Her vivid descriptions and accurate portrayal of life in the circus during the Depression were captivating. Not once did I feel that the story dragged on and the ending left me satisfied. I also felt that the pictures of the circus at the beginning of the chapters were a nice touch.I can't wait to see if I love the movie as much as I loved the book. Rob better not disappoint! ;)""

"""Water for elephants is a good read. It captures the reader's imagination and I found myself really caring about the characters. The author has smoothly incorporated detailed information about the workings of the circus society, creating a bird's eye view of a unique community.""

"""Gosh, how I cried while reading this book! It's such a beautiful and unforgettable story in so many ways, I don't even know where to begin explaining what an absolutely gorgeous must-read this is.The story is told with two voices. It starts with Jacob, a full ninety or ninety and three years old (he can't quite remember), coming to terms with aging and being left on his own by his children, in a facility for the aged; whilst looking back at his time as a drop-out veterinary student when he joined the circus after his parents death. The second voice is of Jacob during the three months he had joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931, and follows the story of him and Rosie the elephant; and him falling irrevocably in love with another man's wife - a love triangle with a difference, for sure. Both these story lines, Jacob as an old man and twenty three year old Jacob, deals with different sides and facets of Jacob.Sarah Gruen is a master character developer. Main and secondary role players were vividly painted as multi-dimensional characters. She wrote them in such a striking way that before you can stop yourself, you've lost your heart to quite a few of them, including the animals. Rosie, of course, is the star in this book and if nothing else, her trials and tribulations as well as her spectacular sense of humor, had me laughing and wiping tears at the same time.If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book yet, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. As great as the movie was, the book touched me on so many more levels than I could've imagined. I was riveted by the author's writing and the skilful manner in which she pulled me into Jacob's reality. I experienced so many emotions along with the various characters, and at times felt I could strangle August for what he put Rosie, Marlena and Jacob through.Most memorable line which made me smile: """"Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of.""""The well-executed, fast-paced plot - fraught with twists and turns - also had moments of humor woven into it, and I finished this book feeling breathless from the anticipation, excitement and sheer excellence of this imaginative story and its realistically-sketched characters. It was clear to me that the author did in-depth research for this novel. If you don't purchase the book, at least watch the movie. But """"Water for Elephant"""" definitely makes my list of top ten most memorable books that must be read in one's lifetime. Sara Gruen now has another proud new fan!""
"
"""I love to read but I am very picky about the books I read. If I start a book and don't find it entertaining enough right away, I won't waste my time reading it. If I find a decent book, I will read it when convenient. But when I find a truly captivating book, I will not be able to put it down. This is rare for me, and this book was good enough that I couldn't put it down. I will admit, I did know the general storyline before I read the book because I saw the movie first, but I wish I had read the book first. It was well written and the author seems to have done a fair amount of research on the subject or animals, circuses, etc. The reason I say I saw the movie first is because I knew when I was reading that if there was any kind of uneventful period in the book, I knew something important was still ahead. I don't recall any """"boring"""" sections, but if there were, the book was still wonderful. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good love story, action story, or just plain good, well written story.""

"""In a story spanning seventy years,  Water for Elephants starts in depression-era America as a young veterinary student named Jacob Jankowski who runs from tragic circumstances, joins a circus, and then reflects on his memories at the end of his life while in a home for the aged. This book is rich in themes. It is a story about coming of age, circus life, elephants, love, friendships, cruelty, mental illness, dignity, life in an old folks home, and old age itself. Author Sara Gruen has created a world of vivid characters and scenes centering on a traveling circus. Life in this environment can be harsh and cruel, but it also has a glamorous side and a close-knit community in which decency sometimes prevails. The reader will feel the chill of despair and revulsion, but also the emotions that warm one's heart. So much goes on in Water for Elephants that I will not begin to describe the plot or all the characters. Everything is unforgettable and I find myself wondering what happened where the story left off because there is a lot more to tell. I doubt Gruen will write a sequel, but I will eagerly await one if she does.""

"This is such a nice book.  I truely recommend it. You can't put it down after you start reading.
"
"I absolutely loved this book!! I couldn't put it down!! You should definitely read this it's amazing!! Beautiful all the way through!!&lt;3&lt;3
"
"Didn't want this book to end.  Read slowly to savor the reading experience.
"
"""""""I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other."""" So begins Sara Gruen's near love letter to the circus, and it's inhabitants. Told in flashbacks by the eldery Jacob Jankowski, it's how he came to work as the vet for the Benzini Brothers, a second rate Barnum and Bailey, traveling across the country. A cast of ragtag characters bring the bigtop to life including a little person named Walter, the sadistic ring master August, and his beautiful performer wife Marlena who Jacob desperately longs for.This would make a fanatastic movie if it isn't already in progress. It has all the elements, from melancholy sentiment, to sweeping romance, and the allure of the magical world of the three rings.""
"
"""I have never written an Amazon review but I frequently look to the reviews to determine what book I'll read next. Without a doubt, this book deserves my first review and 5 stars. It was entertaining, educational, and captivating. I feel in love with the characters in the book and found the book hard to put down.""
"
"It was a great book. It was very descriptive. Reading it was like a movie playing in my head. You could tell that the author had done a lot of research on the circus. It was a great book indeed.
"
"This was my first novel by Sara Gruen and I loved it. I was hooked from the first page. She has a way of making everything so real especially in how she described Rosie the elephant. I fell in love with Rosie. Did not want this story to end and it does have a very surprising ending.
"
"""I started reading thsi book after hearing about the movie.  I started at work on my lunch hour and boy that was rough.  The first part starts out pretty intense and then snaps you back to present day.  You continute this pattern throughout the book and it can occasionally become intrusive or hard to recognize for a moment. Reading the thoughts of this old man was hard.  It really makes you think about what you'll feel like when you're 90, or 93.I continuted to read even though the first part of the book seemed to move slowly.  After a while of thinking this I noticed I was already half way through the book!  I hadn't realized how easy it was to get sucked into Jacob's thoughts and to invision his world.  The story may not sound like it's written from an actual male's perspective but there is enough information and detail that this fact becomes somehwat mute.  The way his relationships develop with other characters is realistic.  The way he connects to his animals is even better.I will say that the very ending was nice, but left a little to be desired.  I enjoyed the present day part, however I feel the recalling of memory could have been less rushed and more elaborate and creative.  I can't wait to see what is done with the movie.  I am sure it won't be as good as the book but it might help bring it to life even more and for that, I can't wait!I think most readers will enjoy this book.""
"
"""I fell in love with this book several years ago. After hearing it was going to be a movie, I was VERRRRRRY excited.I re-read the book a few days before the movie came out, just to familiarize myself with the characters and events and again, for the second time fell in love with Jacob & Rosie.  I love the setting, Jacob's flashbacks and the language barrier with Rosie. Definitely worth the few dollars it costs.""

"""Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski, and almost-veterinarian whose life has just fallen apart. As he comes to this realization, Jacob stumbles upon the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus train and hops aboard. He quickly secures his place on the show as the menagerie vet, a position that will change his life forever.Sara Gruen weaves an incredibly realistic tale that allows the reader a rare glimpse into the prohibition era circus lifestyle. The amount of tension throughout the book is always palatable. I often found myself clenching my jaw and holding my breath by the end of a chapter. August is a particularly well-developed character, frightening in the most realistic and entirely plausible way. There is a sense of impending destruction and collapse that builds with each paragraph.This tension is gracefully relieved every few chapters by visiting Jacob, age ninety (or ninety-three), in his current state as a resident at an assisted living facility. Through the telling of Jacob's present story, the reader reaches another level of understanding and can comprehend the meaning of Jacob's earlier experiences in entirely new ways. The tale would be much less satisfying without this continuation of the story, however small it may seem.An issue that must be addressed when talking about Water for Elephants is the treatment of animals. Some scenes in the book are very difficult to read, but it's worth reading through. You will fall in love with so many of the animals as though they're human, and you will be satisfied with their redemption.For me, Water for Elephants receives 5/5 stars. I consider it a """"must read"""" that will forever change the way you think. It's the type of story that won't soon leave your mind.""
"
"""An enchanting story, and not just because of the """"Big Top Magic"""" that the circus brings.  A wonderful read.""
"
"I'm so glad I finally decided to read this book. I couldn't put the book down. The point of view it was written from was perfect and really allows the reader to imagine that he/she is experiencing these things
"
"""This was an interesting story that was well told.  The use of two different narators (one as the young man, the other as an old man) was a very nice touch.""
"
"I loved loved loved this book. I actually consider it one of my favorites now.
"
"I really enjoyed this book.  I read it over a weekend - I usually only read at bedtime - but Water for Elephants was so engaging I found myself wanting to read and read. I've already passed it on to a friend.  Great book!
"
"Weird but still very interesting... I enjoyed this book very much.. It had a very happy ending..I wanted to finish the book as soon as I opened it
"
"Since it was/has been made into a movie.  And as usual the book is always better than the movie.  But the movie does follow the book pretty well.  You just don't get the back story on everything that you do by reading the book.
"
"This book was recommended by a friend...never saw the movie but I enjoyed the writing and the character developments.  Aging is a progession that we all endure..makes one think about the end of the ride.
"
"""One of the best books I have ever read!!!! If you're looking for a great book that totally engulfs you, then this is it!""
"
"""Like Water for Elephants is my first summer read for this year.  It was an excellent read.  I was drawn into the circus world and captivated by the characters.  I enjoyed learning about the heirarchy of the circus.  The main characters were inviting.  I have now added Sara Gruen's other books to my """"must read"""" list.""
"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end!  I now have a new respect for Circus people and animals.  I couldn't put the book down.
"
"""A great story from beginning to end. The information about life working for the """"Big Top"""" is entertaining and absorbing. Drama, excitement, hardship, and a love story make this an excellent read.""
"
"""I purchased this book reluctantly, since it didn't sound like my """"cup of tea"""".  I mainly wanted to read it before I saw the movie, which is the order I like to do this, especially when I can see the movie and then refer back to the book to refresh my memory.  But in spite of myself, I enjoyed the book very much, and read it into the late hours last night(and early morning) because I didn't want to go to sleep until I finished it!I like the way the author goes back and forth in time; it is well done and easy to follow - sometimes this device can get confusing if not properly handled!  I'm not much of a circus person; of course I went when I was a child, then again with children and grandchildren, but I had a fear of animals that has been only partially conquered thanks to my grandson's love of them.  I have always stood in the back of crowds at Mardi Gras parades due to my major fear of horses!  But this book to me was enough about the human side as to make the circus details palatable, even interesting.I especially enjoyed the story line at the """"retirement community"""" since I have a good friend who works at one, and I used to advertise for the place when I had a radio talk show called """"Life Begins at 50"""".  Needless to say, I am a senior myself and without giving away too much information, I felt that the scenes there were very real.  I would highly recommend this book, especially to seniors and their families - not only for the enjoyment, but for the relationship insights therein.""
"
"I couldn't stop turning the pages! I was entranced throughout the whole book! I never got bored! I would recommend this book to people comfortable reading derogatory things.
"
"""This was one of my favorite reads of the year.  Generally, the subject matter (circuses during the Great Depression era) would not be the kind of thing that I would normally be interested in, but my friend recommended the book.  I fell in love with the characters immediately.  The story was riveting, and the subject matter turned out to be very interesting indeed.  Of course, I loved the elephant.  A very worth read.""
"
"""Even though I do not patronize circuses & didn't want to read about one, this was certainly interesting, steeping the reader in the Depression times and all that it implied & actually doing exactly what the author intended, hissing the bad guy & loving the couple who surmount all odds & win in the end.""
"
"BOOK IS BOTH OF HISTORICAL VALUE AND WONDERFUL LOVE STORY ALONG WITH GREAT PORTRAYAL OF INVISIBILITY OF OLD AGE THROWN IN.
"
"""At first, the notion of reading a book about the seamy side of a 70-year-old circus sounded like an automatic rejection when I casually picked it up off Mom's side table in Buffalo at Christmas. I intensely dislike circuses and always have. But I always love Mom's book choices - we regularly exchange reading lists - so, given a choice between doing sloppy dinner dishes and pretending to read so I could look hands-off-me engrossed, I hunched down in the chair and read a few pages. Then a few more, then a couple of chapters. Then I vaguely heard my husband yelling that we HAD to leave or we'd be late for something or other. Dang!Two weeks later, back home 8 hours away, I couldn't stop thinking about it when I lead my annual book club retreat at which each 18 of us presents two book choices, argues in their favor, and we each vote for six. The top 11 get picked for the year. My passionate plea gave Water for Elephants an elite spot there. Now I had an excuse to exchange my kids' college education fund for an Amazon order. The book arrived on my bedside table in three days and didn't have time to gather dust as I polished it off in the next two.The story is captivating right from the start because the scenery and characters are so richly portrayed and the plot thickens like creme brulee. I adore books that are based on fact and comprehensively researched - even fiction - and this was a beautifull amalgamation of many true circuses. Sara Gruen exposed me to a world I never would have entered if she hadn't pulled it all together and made the circus a character in itself, filled it with compassion and drama, and layered it so well. She moves from the realm of an all-too-real current nursing home that is as disturbing as it is humorous and insightful, to a thoughtful young man's coming of age that is as disturbing as it is humorous and insightful. I came away with a new appreciation for circuses, old men, and the sometimes treacherous journeys that face all youth.A caution, though. I would not rank this as among the most elevated reads, but it isn't meant to be. It's a wonderful tale and I'd put her in the same category as Barbara Kingsolver or Somerset Maugham. A terrific storyteller. But not quite literature in the finest sense of that word, where Tolstoy and Joyce and Hugo thrive. But too much of them shatters bedside tables. So now I'm waiting for Gruen's next to lighten the load of my day.""
"
"""I SAW THE MOVIE AND IT WAS GOOD, BUT THE BOOK WAS EXCEPTIONAL!  I LIKE MOVIES AND BOOKS THAT END WELL, AND THIS ONE DID.  I FIGURE THAT IF I'M GOING TO PAY FOR ENTERTAINMENT, I WANT TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.""
"
"I still haven't watched the movie and don't intend to. The book was amazing and I read it in about 2 days because I just couldn't put it down!
"
"Wonderful book.  It kept my attention through the entire book.  I did wish there had been more on their life together later.
"
"""Poignant, infinitely tender, and with such depth and substance, I so enjoyed Sara Gruen's crafting of this novel.""
"
"I lent it to my mother and bought this paper back version for my daughter. She shared it with all her friends.  Much different story than the movie.
"
"""While not particularly deep, this book covers a lot  of territory and fills in a lot of background to what has been my sketchy knowledge of circus life.  I'm not really interested in circuses, but this was an interesting book and gave yet another dimension to my understanding of the Great Depression.  Some of the minor characters take on real depth, including Walter, some of the general circus laborers, and, of course, Rosie.  And it really purges the emotions and releases a lot of pent up anger in a hilarious and horrible act of vengence.This is a good and well-told story.""
"
"""What a delightful book!  I learned so much about the circus and its workings, truly a treasure. In between all the """"depressing issues"""" there were moments of true goodness and hope. I've recommended it to all my reading friends.""
"
"I like to read books that become movies or travels in my mind. this was my first book with my kindle fire. I made a good choice!
"
"""heard about this book from a friend and was unable to put it down! as a healthcare worker, the character of older jacob has insights all should be aware of and consider. vivid imagery and a fascinating plot. highly reccomended""
"
"This was a wonderful story--  I especially enjoyed the parts about Jacob when he was a young man.  He dealt with the hardships of life..  made the best of it and stayed true to his character and integrity.  I recommend it for anyone--  and I know that I will re-read this book again.
"
"This was a great book.  It sucked you in within the first chapter and kept you sucked in the whole book.  I never wanted to put the book down even to go to sleep!
"
"""I throughly enjoyed this book, and when I finished, it left me wanting more.  As a vet tech, who has devoted her life to animal care, I felt a kinship with Jacob.  The animal abuse was both heart breaking and apalling, and moved me to tears more than once.  The treatment of the workers and the hardships they faced left me feeling sorrowful as well.  That aside, it was a wonderful, passionate love story, one that I personally will not forget, and I absolutely loved the ending.  I highly recommend this book, and I can't wait for the movie.""
"
"This is a good book it's a nice easy read. It's got a little something for everyone. Worth the money.

"""Water for elephants is one of the best books l,'ve read in sometime.Hard to quit reading once you start.highly recommended for all adults.""
