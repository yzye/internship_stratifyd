"""I have to admit that I am a fan of Giada's cooking and I had great expectations when I ordered this set. They were however, crushed. While I still love Giada's cooking, this set is just a way for Food Network to make money. They really cheated with these DVD's. All they have are the video from the show, no text recipes, no link to the on line shows and no computer support. They play in Windows media player but the set does not contain the recipes. You can get more by taping the shows and then going to the web to download recipes. Another disappointment is the so so transfer quality to DVD. Perhaps I've been spoiled by HD and Tivo but the older shows I've recorded have had better playback quality than the episodes on the DVD's. It is in the old 480p but the quality of the transfer to DVD is dark and about the same quality as your average old VHS tape, not DVD quality. I get the impression Food Network got cheap and subbed out the DVD transfer to the lowest bidder (China?) and it shows.I could watch Giada read the dictionary and her cooking is really first rate. But, that's all you get is watching Giada. Thank god she is easy to understand and her recipes are easy to follow. But to get consistent results on some of the dishes, you should search the web and find the hard copies.  While Giada herself is great, this set is a waste of money. You're better off recording the shows and going to the web to get the recipes you want or, better yet, just stick with her cookbooks which are all first rate and worlds above this cheap presentation.""

"""""""Why Don't They Just Quit"""" could not hold my attention that I wouldn't even dare to bore my adult substance addiction therapy group with it. To show this to a population of substance abusers would put them to sleep. The kind of addiction films that stimulate my clients are the ones that explain how they got addicted, why they are addicted, and what can be done about it from a psychological, biological, and physiology perspective. Psychological, biological, and physiological films make them feel as if they are a person first with some issues, instead of making them feel they are labeled as a problem with the identity of an alcoholic or addict (a person second) in which this DVD takes that position. Good addiction films today move fast, scene to scene, with music in background and people talking scene to scene with speed. This DVD has the same two or four people sitting around a table talking about """"the alcoholic or drug user"""" with the same monotone voices. The background is black and has a bowl of fruit to look at on the table but doesn't even have something to look at in the background such as cars going by in a window or pictures or a bookshelf. This DVD definitely isn't for substance user/abuser audience or a therapist that already has knowledge about addictions. It is more suited for those that don't know anything about addictions and who doesn't have substance-using issues. I would recommend this DVD for family members experiencing a love one with using issues or a student first learning about addictions for their studies in the mental health or medical field because the DVD pretty much covers all the basics A to Z about understanding a person with alcohol or drug issues. I also recommend, to really get to know what a substance user is experiencing is to attend a few AA and/or NA speaker night meetings to hear how they journeyed through their recovery process.""

I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading.

"
"""The language is poetic, but it is not poetry.  It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  """"Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'""""Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all """"cosmic"""" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: """"He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.""""Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this """"It Takes a Village"""" gem: """"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.""""  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  """"The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.""""  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of """"The Prophet"""" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:""""Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'""""Forget that Jesus said, """"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.""""  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole """"one source, many wells"""" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  """"Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!""""  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of """"love thy neighbor"""" philosophy, it still defines """"good"""" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a """"do unto others"""" prescription, but """"You are good when you are one with yourself.""""If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, """"Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.""""  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (""""a truth"""") to God:""""Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.""""Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  """"You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!""""  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (""""You are good when you are one with yourself,"""" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of """"The Prophet.""""  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that """"The Prophet"""" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that """"The Prophet"""" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word """"hedon.""""  """"Hedonist"""" sounds like a philosophical school, as does """"epicurean.""""  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)""

Though the transient prophet indeed speaks eloquently and his words inspire deep reflection, they fail to impart true understanding.

"""Gibran reveals the fundamental optimism that shapes the rest of his thinking in his response to one of the city judges:&quot;Like the ocean is your god-self;It remains for ever undefiled.And like the ether it lifts but the winged.Even like the sun is your god-self;It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.&quot;This belief in a holy inner spiritual component of every man provides the foundation of such assertions as the moral nondistinction between criminal and victim. This may all sound good, but in practice has little to do with what we observe in the world around us (and is completely unworkable both individually and in society!)The traditional Christian view, boring though it may at first seem, is that there is no perfect holiness within us; rather, we holistic unities of imperfection and rebellion. Granted, we consist of both material and immaterial substance, but the material and immaterial are inseperable except by death. Gibran deals with the rational problems arising from his irreconcilable view of the sprit versus the world by, of course, positing reincarnation upon us.Christian theology deals with all the issues addressed by Gibran, but without making us all out to be God. And without relying on the terrible concept of reincarnation (the only thing I can think of that would be worse than enduring a lifetime of suffering would be to endure an endless procession of lifetimes of suffering). Sure, there are many wonderful, truthful passages in this book, but nobody should make the mistake of assuming it to be inspired. So let the reader beware!""

It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how """"relevant"""" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song """"Consider Me Gone"""" for consideration:""""To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell""""""

"""""""The Prophet"""" is Almustafa, called """"the chosen and the beloved,"""" who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as """"Prophet of God"""" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which """"the Prophet"""" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of """"inspirational fiction"""" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, """"the Prophet"""" says, """"Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'""""  Jesus said, """"You shall know THE truth"""" (John 8:32), and, """"I am the way, THE truth, and the life"""" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a """"spiritual masterpiece,"""" so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, """"Ugh.""""  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, """"It's all Greek to me,"""" but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were """"all Greek"""" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet """"brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes.""""  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what """"the Prophet"""" says about clothes.  """"Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.""""  Oh, by the way, even as simply """"poetry"""" it just doesn't do anything for me.  It is not a book that I would recommend to anyone under any circumstances.""

"""I am an avid reader of historical fiction, with the emphasis on the """"historical"""" rather than the """"upthrust breast"""" variety.  This catastrophe fails at both. I have read many many entries in this genre from the extraordinary to the putrid.  Lady of Hay falls somewhere below this last category.  As other readers have commented, this book is about 200 pages too long. The author has managed to confuse tedium with suspense by dragging out the conclusion long past the point of reader exhaustion.  Ms. Erskine's attempts to interweave the present day """"plot"""" with historical narrative is a complete failure, as she only manages to disrupt both story lines resulting in a herky-jerky narrative flow that became quite annoying.  Compounding the problem, not a single character is the slightest bit sympathetic, and although I began the read with curiosity and interest, I ended feeling frustrated and cheated.  There are many red herrings dropped along the way that kept me reading, but I got no satisfaction at the end.  Why do we meet everyone's mother?  How many literary agents, photographers and editors need to be introduced by their names, only to drop from sight 20 pages later?  What about nurse Jeanne's foreshadowing of Matilda's illegitimate daughter ultimately giving her secret away resulting in calamity?  Did I miss that scene as I waded through episode after repetitive episode of modern Jo swooning in the rain as she """"channels"""" Lady Matilda?  There are too many superfluous characters, seemingly all of whom are interested in and experienced with past life regression, who I kept expecting would have some role in the overall """"meaning"""" of this morass, but they never did.  Not to mention, most of the players seem good candidates for Alcoholics Anonymous.  I cannot recall another novel which features wine, ale, scotch, Pimms and their ilk as the central focus in seemingly every scene.  The insane behavior of all principals appeared to be nothing more than the result of years of alcohol poisoning - a Medieval Lost Weekend.  I became so exasperated with their antics and cruel misdeeds that I actually found myself rooting for them all to be sent to the pokey or a rehab facility.This book was a major disappointment in every way.  It is short on history and long on artifice.  If there were some way to award negative stars, this is the ideal candidate.  Save your money.""

At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives.

"I finished this book as fast as I could. I felt the author was on another wavelength to the reader. I didn't care that the story was about this Georgie fellow.

Try Pat McCabe's breakfast on Pluto for energy and  a raw story or Ian McEwan's Amsterdam for a page turner with a plot of some  interest. Thumbs down for this one.
"
"""The back cover of this book praises Beryl Bainbridge for her &quot;deadpan prose&quot; and her &quot;emotionless sentences&quot;. It's ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George's father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George's sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It's like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It's the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got. I skipped over some pages to get to the end. I didn't care about the character's fates. I just wanted to say i finished it.""

"""First of all, it's important to understand that the author penned this reference book in 1919. Quite a lot has changed in the world in the last 90 years. As even he notes, the meaning of the book of Revelation was to be sealed until the time that it would become pertinent. Which is to say, nobody would quite get it until the events start to unfold and it all suddenly makes sense. I highly doubt a book that was written before commercial airplanes existed would present the best explanation for events happening in a world dominated by smartphones, the internet, debit cards, and did I mention commercial airlines?Be that as it may, it still explains the basics of eschatology fairly well, altho in a very culturally quaint way. In spite of its lack of modern sophistication it gets the main historical points right. But if you want to REALLY understand the end times prophecies, you'll need to dig a lot deeper than this book. And this is essentially the same as 90% of all eschatological reference materials, which mostly explain (wrongly) that the Antichrist will be a jew and will be accepted and outwardly benevolent by jews for a time. Or conversely, that he will be a pope and the allegedly revived Roman Empire will be the one world religion and government that will persecute the jews and christians.The problem with this author, having written his book so long ago, is that his world wasn't aware of the huge upsurge of Islamic antagonism that would become prevalent in the future. If you read this book, I don't think you'll notice a single reference to Islam. But if you study Islamic prophecy, you'll see a huge parallel with the book of Revelation. However, the good guys and the bad guys are on completely different sides depending on which religion you're studying. While there are always """"two sides to any story"""", there will be only one right side in this epic. Christianity claims Jesus is the son of God. Islam claims Jesus is a prophet (of lower importance than Muhammed) and that he (Jesus) will return in the End Times to proclaim Christianity to be false. Islam says that Jesus is a muslim who was never crucified.In reality, Islam is the Beast. The Islamic Madhi to come is the Antichrist (probably from Fatima, Italy). A muslim 'jesus', as predicted in Islamic prophecy, is the False Prophet. None of that is mentioned in this book. But then, it's rarely mentioned in any book written more than 5 years ago. Since the assumptions of the main characters is off, much of the supporting information of this book is also off base.I'm not saying don't read this book. I'm just saying it's not all accurate. But it has really nice woodcut images.""

"""This is another example of christian fundamentalists who hate everything & everyone who does not abide by their views.  For years they have ranted against society & tried to set little christian worlds apart from the rest of us (as if it was really possible to totally cut themselves from the rest of the world).  But now, not content with living alienated, dull, boring, repressed & illogical lives themselves, they now conspire with their dim-witted acolytes to take away from our children one of the few unsoiled fun holidays of the great American tradition.  Halloween is a far better holiday than Christmas.  During Halloween we have no choice but to trust our fellow human beings as we allow our children to partake of the merryment of the season.  Christmas pays hollow homage to doing good deads to others - in practice, Christmas good deeds are all done towards close family & friends only.  Precious few outside do partake of the kindness despite all platitudes & pompous verbosity to the contrary.  But during Halloween we are all forced to trust others & to live up to that trust ourselves.  We care for and enliven the joy of strangers & their children.  We allow for their exhuberance & they reciprocate.  Neighbors who for 364 days of the year (Christmas included) may pretend you do not exist, now amicably talk with you & join in the joy.  There is no more socially-minded civic holiday in the American tradition than Halloween.  But the thought pattern this book exemplifies sees only evil & darkness in Halloween.  They come up with all sorts of suggestions on how to ensnare a future generation of children away from the holiday into the clutches of their mindset.  By all means, read the book yourself to make up your own opinions on it.  However, I encourage you to read it for free from a library or internet website rather than paying for it.

"""While it may lose that crown of shame to the Tormont edition ofThe Brave Little Tailor, this awful rendering of Hugh Lofting's Doctor Dolittle is nevertheless sure to disappoint on every level.The adaption by Al Perkins? Dumb-talk for children, with a confusing message to boot. The book starts with a cliche: """"Once upon a time, there was a doctor"""" and it's all downhill from there. The second sentence insults the intelligence of any reader, regardless of age: """"The M.D. meant that he was a doctor and that he knew a lot."""" (!) Upon Dr. Dolittle's arrival in Africa, readers are exposed to one of the worst misrepresentations ever seen in a children's book: """"The Doctor found hundreds and thousands of very sick monkeys. He made all the monkeys come to be vaccinated [Three days later] Doctor Dolittle saw that none of the monkeys were sick any more. They were all well! His vaccinations had cured them all."""" I am fairly certain that even in 1920, vaccinations provided immunity against future disease rather than curing an existing ailment. The illustrations by Philip Wende? Creepy. The monkeys look like aliens or possibly Australopithecus.Compared to modern children's literature, the message here is heavy-handed and politically incorrect. The African savages are violent and dumb. The King sleeps in a bed decorated with skulls. Fearful of the unknown, he imprisons Dr. Dolittle as a medicine-man along with his band of animals. Even more fearful of being cursed--with mumps, no less! Who subsidized this printing, the CDC?--the king is tricked into freeing them. Score one for the colonial powers! The story in its original form, like those featuring that other simian Curious George, will set off a modern PC Geiger counter. And this version doesn't even include the infamous white-face incident from the original Story of Doctor Dolittle! Finally, and just like the Man with the Yellow Hat, Dr. Dolittle brings home a souvenir from the old country in the form of a live pet.In summary, even if you like the original story in all its early 20th century glory, this version will disappoint. Everyone else will be disgusted straightaway. Worst of all, this book (as published in 1967) carries the Random House seal of approval in the form of the Cat in the Hat-emblazoned """"Beginner Books"""" imprint, leading some to believe this book might have been worth having.

"""In """"An Apple a Day"""" the McGill University professor Joe Schwarcz offers salient useful nutritional advice.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate.  Emphasize variety and balance in your diet.  Avoid processed foods, especially those high in fat, sugar, and salt.  Exercise.  There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet.That's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book.  I have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being Dr. Schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there:  organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on.  It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis:  that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle.  There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement.  Quite the opposite:  eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  Seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health.""

"
"""Schwarcz is a Professor of Chemistry who has written several books about diet and nutrition. Judging by this book I'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.I'm not saying that Schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?I majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can't really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about """"the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat."""" Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be """"an occasional treat,"""" and even then the portion size """"should cover a small portion of the plate."""" Those people who still believe in the """"myth"""" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz's book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.I can't forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that """"Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy."""" Schwarcz responds by saying, """"True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle."""" He leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the """"very different diet and lifestyle"""" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study """"which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures."""" Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who """"criticizes"""" milk consumption as part of the """"antimilk lobby,"""" driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we """"look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium."""" Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses """"antimilk"""" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).This is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that """"leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.""""? I'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk """"is not a poison,"""" as some fringe members of PETA might say.In conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. You know the drill: Eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest. If you do all that don't worry about whatever else you like to eat!""

"""I bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books at amazon.ca. I've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled """"Milk and Calcium"""", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a """"nutrition authority"""".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.Don't Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World's Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, """"Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!"""" He fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, """"But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture"""".""""The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning.""""( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the """"breast milk"""" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) """"That's hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.""""He tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this """"self-selected subgroup"""". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a """"trace of dioxin"""". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring """"water"""" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, """"A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.""""Of course he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their """"natural"""" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while """"milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA"""".Webster's Dictionary defines poison as, """"a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill"""".It's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While """"milk and calcium"""" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility.

My biggest beef with this book is the quality of writing, and I always wonder how books like this make the best seller's list. I found the dialogue was not only thin, but so obviously written by a woman that it was impossible to believe in the male narration.  It would also have been more believable if the author had vaguely attempted to match the dialogue to the era in which the story took place (did they really say f**k that much back then?) The copy I had was from our local library, and on one page the statement """"...Whatever"""", as in 'big deal', had been circled in pencil with the comment (in an old person's handwriting) """"not from the '30's""""--that rather summed it up.  I got tired of the cheesy descriptions of sex and violence -- believe me, the human imagination is very capable, and less is more in these areas in the hands of a capable writer.

"""I, like many others, picked up this book because of its adoring fans and glowing reviews. However, after having to force myself to finish the book, I am left with feeling utterly unimpressed and wishing I had spent my time doing menial house chores instead.First, the characters were one-dimensional. They frequently did things that were out of character (why would a jealous man keep inviting his """"competition"""" on dates with he and his wife??), we don't know any background information or history of characters, and are left feeling completely disconnected and emotionally distant. They are all cliche stock characters.Second, the love story is written atrociously. We are expected to just accept that two characters fall in love when they've barely had the chance to exchange ten words with each other. We are expected to accept a """"love at first sight"""" situation here, but I feel like that is just lazy writing. There are two scenes later where they finally have a moment of emotional connection, but the development of their love is noticeably absent, which left me not really caring for the rest of the book about their relationship because it felt so fake and superficial.Third, there are random, unnecessary sex scenes. I will give anyone 20 dollars who can find 10 pages in a row that doesn't mention an erection, male genitalia, two random strangers in the background having sex, or breasts. I will admit that a well placed love scene can add to the progression of a story. But this was filled with so many explicit descriptions it was just plain tasteless.Overall, it is just bad writing with terrible story and character development, which is too bad, because the basic story itself could have been very intriguing and brought to light a lot about the history of America during the depression. I wish this had been written by a better author who knows how to write well. If America thinks this is glorious literature, I fear for the future.""

What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It's never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn't tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own """"love"""" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don't want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that I strongly believe that Jacob, the narrator and main character, absolutely positively does NOT deserve the long and largely happy life he'll eventually get to lead. It's one thing to care about animals and less fortunate humans. That test, Jacob passes with flying colors. But when it comes to moderating one's own urges and balancing them against the well-being of others (all others close to you, not just Marlena, the love interest), Jacob gets a huge F-.""

It wasn't until half way through the book when Jacob finally admits he's in love with her and it's so lackluster I didn't really believe it.  Perhaps I feel this way because I had just finished reading """"Wurthering Heights"""" before this and expecting more passion between the young lovers; however I'm not interested in reading this book again to find out if that's true.......which is saying a lot.  I thought the most interesting part of the book was the Q&A portion at the end where Gruen talks about her research and how all the events that took place on and off the train were based on real events that happened to various circus's during that time.  Knowing that did kind of put those events into prospective, but not really being interested in circus history is where it failed to capture me.

My main problem with the novel, however, is that the characters are one dimensional.  They always seem to be doing dramatic things and facing tragedy after tragedy, but I couldn't connect because there is very little reflection or internal monologue (not even in the retirement home!).  The story clips along at such a quick pace it gets bogged down by its own far-fetched events.  I found it difficult to understand why the characters, and even Rosie the elephant, act the way they do--everything seems trumped up to make the plot work. I can't say I even completely understand the title.  I got the connection to the man in the retirement home who claimed he carried water for elephants, but what in the heck did this have to do with the story?

You can see the animals and feel the angst that the circus employees go through under their sadistic leaders.  That being said, I can't say that Marlena is a well-developed character.  I don't feel as though we know why Jacob fell in love with her, beyond the fact that she was beautiful and cared about her animals.

"""Thankfully I read this for free from the Kindle Prime lending library - I would not have wanted to actually spend money on this book.The beginning of the story with the older Jacob reminiscing was initially interesting but from there on, the story went downhill for me.For one thing, I couldn't shake off a distinct impression of deja vu as I read this book. Then it struck me that I was strongly remindedof Stephen King's """"The Green Mile"""" when I read the old Jacob sections (very old man in an old person's home reminiscing about anoddly sentient animal while struggling to retain his identity in the face of unsympathetic caregivers). There's even the Popeye/Olive Oyl8-pager which is also referenced in """"The Green Mile"""".  The Jacob/Marlena/August triangle was similar to the onein William Styron's """"Sophie's Choice"""" (volatile charming Jewish man with a personality  disorder married to a younger sensitive woman, theyoung man taken under the older man's wing falling in love with the wife, resulting in violence and upheaval).But beyond that, the Jacob/Marlena love story was very poorly developed. Marlena never came together as a three-dimensionalcharacter.  When older Jacob talks about his wife and how she was his helpmeet at the beginning of the book, a weak, passive character such as Marlena was not the woman I pictured. I certainly don't understand why he fell so deeply in love with her. The ending was feel-good but nevertheless unsatisfying due to its lack of realism.The few plus points in this book are the quirky secondary characters such as Walter and Camel. The thematic setting of a traveling circus was also interesting but after reading the author interview included with the Kindle version, it seems a lot of the side plots and atmospheric color were lifted largely unaltered from actual instances the author read or heard about while researching the book.Given the hype, I didn't expect a book that I will barely remember in another month except for its similarity to other, better works.""

Getting older and not a """"spring chicken"""" anymore is depressing and to think of how quickly life is passing me by each hour of everyday is as glum as you can get.

I also agree with the reviewer who took offense at the haphazard use of the """"paranoid schizophrenic"""" diagnosis. There is enough stigma about mental illness in the world, and whether or not it was part of the language of the time is beside the point.

Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age.  So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise.  Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop.  Probably one of the worst books I've read this decade.  Under no circumstances read this poor excuse for a novel.  The fact that so many reviewers have given it 5-stars is a mystery on par with the Bermuda Triangle. Is it collective hysteria? I just don't get it.""

"""I'm grateful that I took the time to read the reviews for this book.  I was set to buy it - based on others' recommendations and the five-star rating - and I was curious to see what the 74 """"one-star reviews"""" had to say.  At first, it seemed as though these bad reviews were just people complaining; I've seen people complain about something popular just to come off as being more sophisticated and cultured than the masses.  As I continued to read the reviews, several issues kept repeating: poorly developed, stock characters, unconvincing dialogue, and the trite and inappropriately-contemporary narrative taking into consideration the period of the story, etc.  Not to mention most of the reviews relating disgust at the gratuitous and awkwardly-written sex scenes.  They also all seem to lament over the thin, predictable plot.  The criticism went on and on.  Not much mincing of words here.  I took one reviewer's advice and searched through the book on Amazon's hard-copy sampler to get a feel for the story...Granted, I only read several pages of the book as I bounced around the sampler - but that's all it took for me to discover the same poor writing described in all of the one-star reviews.  The writing I sampled in Water for Elephants was, in all honesty, no more sophisticated than a middle-school reading level, which was genuinely surprising.  I instantly recognized the complaints listed above, and felt disappointed.  I do believe that the astounding success of this book, unfortunately, speaks volumes of its audience, the average American reader.  That so many give it such high literary praise beyond what it seemingly is - a marginally entertaining """"beach read"""" - demonstrates, to me, how comfortable we've become with mediocrity.  I'm writing this review to join the ranks of those who guard their """"five-star reviews"""" more closely.  Thank you, one-star reviewers, for saving me from assured disappointment.""

I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere.

I didn't like this book and here is why:The Nursing home: Too much like the notebook, which is why the movie was changed.Characters: If the characters were food, they'd be dry turkey that went down like sandpaper. I think she could've spent more time developing them. I really didn't care about any of their troubles.Movements: The reader doesn't have to know every little movement the cardboard character makes. Everytime he/she stares we know. Everytime he/she looks out the window we know. I felt like it was stage direction.Love: The love just came like a weed out of nowhere. No building to it, no depth, just One day """" Oh, Hi. You have issues because your parents died and oh great! You love animals just like me"""" and Jacob was attracted to her since she laid on a horse in sequins - - Boom!  It felt very forced by the writer. I think she should research classic love stories or atleast work on a more believable build up.Husband: The main character's husband was a pseudo-gray character, shifting from bad to good in two seconds. The author didn't spend enough time researching schizophrenia, which was unfortunate because it could've made August a more believable character. I feel she just wanted to give him a reason to be a jerk so that the reader can sympathize with Marlena and Jacob's affair.Marlena: zzzzz. Very boring woman and same as all the other cliche Betty Sue characters. Orphan ofcourse. Abusive husband.Jacob: Didn't really connect with him, but I guess he was okay. Parents died so sympathy is needed.Research: I don't get why everyone is so surprised that the author researched the circus for her book. Every author must research. She did a good job though. Lots of details and I could tell she understood the circus life.Smut: I'm no prude, but the smut is contrived for the sack of being edgy/gritty. For example, Jacob randomly walks in on a masturbating dwarf. And the circus racy side shows - - plus the girl in the beginning whose a tease to Jacob - - oh yeah, and the football team's orgy. I can tell that this is written by a woman because the male behaviors seem more for shock value and not natural.The writing itself is above average.""

The author picked what should have been a foolproof, intriguing setting and managed to botch it.  On top of everything else, our supposed protagonist was so annoying that I wanted to punch him in the face (even the boring, cheesy old-man version of the protagonist.)

I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her.

He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?!

And then Jacob keeps harping about it: """"He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!"""" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses """"paranoid schizophrenia"""" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be """"paranoid,"""" turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though.

The depression-era circus setting, although intriguing, was not enough to make up for the endless vulgarity, flat characterization and vapid dialogue. And, to make matters worse, no character, at least from the ones I can remember, is spared horrific scenes of physical abuse - you name it, woman, worker, elephant, dog, clown. I just got tired of it all after a while.Why did I even bother to finish it? It was sort of like watching Ripley's Believe it or Not to see what kind of ghastly thing would happen next.

"""Known to acquaintances as an elephant-lover, this book was suggested to me several times. I finally bought it on a whim while purchasing gifts for others. It was a quick read, and very disappointing.I found myself too often angry with the poor choices that the characters made. I also found myself freqently questioning implausible scenes (for example: Jacob's friends being tossed from the train while Jacob himself was on top of the train, struggling unaware towards the villian's car--ridiculous!--he would have seen or heard the others who were carrying out this murderous eviction, wouldn't he?).The love story aspect of Jacob and Marlene was not believable in the slightest to me--in fact it was abhorent.  August's bizarre and sadistic behavior is attributed to paranoid schizophrenia, however, the author did not have a good handle on describing that psychiatric disorder.Despite some trifles of circus history interwoven into the story, the circus in question is as underdeveloped as the characters. The author suggests that this work parallels the Biblical story of Jacob. I didn't know that until AFTER I had read the book, and would NEVER have dreamed of a connection without her assertion; that's really far-fetched.Unfortunately, the undercurrent of animal abuse, neglect, and suffering is what will linger in my mind as I reflect on, """"Water for Elephants.""""I would NEVER want to see a movie based on this book!""

"""Water for Elephants has its good moments (a particular incident late in the book, during which the protagonist is standing over a sleeping but dangerous man with knife in hand trying to decide what to do next is hauntingly poignant), but all told, I'm glad that I read this book through the Kindle leasing program rather than buying it.There are several themes in Water for Elephants, including the lack of dignity often associated with the treatment of the elderly and the evil effects of greed. However, the backbone of the story seems to be a sort of iconoclasm. The Sterling images of the circus often inculcated in us during childhood are challenged by images of violence, animal cruelty, and graphic sexuality. However, the fact that this book unearths the dark side of the early twentieth century circus speaks less to its quality than to the fact that our society all too often allows commercialism and popular mythology to shape our images of the past. Simply challenging false notions held by society contributes very little to the value of a story like this one. In the end, the tone of the book takes on moods which can change violently from the darkly cynical to the unrealistically optimistic (the ending of the book feels impossible, illegal, and unsafe). Sentimentality, rather than a meaningful exploration of human emotion, dominates the scenes of the assisted living facility, although as noted above, the fact that those scenes also bring to light the continuing need for respect to the elderly does serve to redeem them to a decent extent.The story is, on some level, a """"forbidden romance"""", and on this level, it has many failings. The rapidity with which Marlena falls for Jacob seems more indicative of a woman torn by the violent nature of her relationship than a woman in anything approaching love. The way in which August is killed seems to do nothing but Grant a legitimacy to the relationship via Pacidermis ex Machina, and to tie up loose ends.All in all, this isn't an awful book, but it seems to be the type of story commonly found in book discussion groups for all of two months before being rapidly forgotten. There is no real draw, beyond a handful of tense and well-written moments in the last quarter of the story.For the Kindle edition, images work surprisingly well, and I have no real complaints about formatting.""

Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable.""

At its sporadic best, this novel is a good read. The author has chosen an interesting world and time to write about and obviously done her homework. But homework is not enough. The great nagging problems however are she is neither a good nor original writer. Consequently the characters she has created are wooden and every third sentence out of their mouths is either predictable or a howling cliche. The characters themselves are comprised of one cliche after the other-- the good hearted innocent hero, the evil boss, the plucky sidekick (a dwarf, no less),the bewitching damsel in distress, the schizo villain who is mean to animals... You've seen them all too many times before in books, movies, even cartoons. So when they meet their fates you shrug because you guessed what would happen to each of them fifty pages(or more) before.

"""I got this book because I have always found elephants to be fascinating animals and I love to read about them.

When she finally showed, her personality was not developed like I wanted it to be.  It really was lacking.  There were bits and pieces but the animal was by no means the star of this book as advertised.The other thing that bothered me about this book were the very explicit sex scenes that I was not ready for at all.  I had no idea these were in the book.  I don't know if any reviewers wrote about that but next time I will read more reviews before getting any book.  Now I'm stuck with it on my device.

Can't comment on Robert Pattinson's acting other than the Twilight movies, but thought I could get an idea of what he would be like in the movie based upon his character.  I am almost finished with the book and am still waiting for something interesting to happen.  Decided to look at the reviews to see if I was missing anything.  The one stars seem to match my opinion so far.  None of these characters seem to have any depth, especially the protagonist.  Maybe the nurses and definitely Greg, who someone else mentioned, because he seemed to be the smartest one in the scheme of things by figuring out a way to communicate with the elephant.  I can't say I like anyone in this book or really care what happens to any of them.  Camel isn't even a sympathetic character, maybe he will have some purpose, but just seems to be an annoying filler at the moment.  Even the descriptions of the performances with the elephant and the horses was boring.  I guess I will muddle along even though I feel like I'm wasting my time.  I assume what's her name gets away with murder, so to speak, but if that's the case, the most exciting part of the book was the beginning.

While there were a FEW interesting parts, there wasn't enough for me love this book like everyone else.

I mainly read it because I thought it would give me a little insight into his life.All I can say is that I am baffled why so many thought this book was so great.The imagery was fuzzy, at best. While I could imagine what the elephant looked like, the rest of the characters threw me for a loop. The character development was practically absent, even for the main characters, except that they were all horny and wanted the people they couldn't have.I also wondered about all the sex? It felt like I was reading a trashy novel at times. I felt dirty - the author seemed to spend a lot more time describing all the different types of sex that the characters had instead of describing the characters themselves.I was hoping that this claimed """"well-researched"""" historical novel would give insight into the lives of circus entertainers before and during the great depression.

"
"""I hesitate to slap a derisive label like """"chick lit"""" on anything, but author Sara Gruen's third novel is a prime example of the worst kind of """"women's fiction""""; Water for Elephants was obviously written by a woman solely for other women, with no attempt to be realistic from the male point of view. Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him """"unshaven"""" with the implication that what he really means is """"unclean,"""" you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and """"chick flicks"""" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a """"twist"""" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, """"Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it! Now downstake it!"""" [p. 34].(Yeah, that's what she said!)""
"
"""I rarely pick up best-sellers, but I felt compelled to torture myself through this one after Gruen was awarded -- in a baffling but sickeningly telling example of how lowest-common-denominator and bottom-line the book publishing business has become -- $5 million for her next two, as yet un-penned books. I've got $10 that says they involve touchy-feely maudlin interaction between people and animals and cliched romanctic treacle. I wouldn't be shocked to see a unicorn rear its head.This novel is cliche and a pastiche of formula coopted from other, better books from cover to cover. The dialogue is PAINFUL. Every line feels prepackaged for the movie studio executive Gruen undoubtedly set out to placate before writing one word. Worse, while characters speak in cliched colloquial style, it remains ONE style. There is little to distinguish one voice from another. The plot, too, proceeds along a rote path -- I was predicting nearly every turn of it paragraphs, and then pages, ahead of time.Gruen is justly commended for her research into circus history, which is the only original element she brings to the table. She clearly delights in it, though even that reads like dutiful observations culled from a torrent of microfiche and historical society archives. It's clear Gruen has spent a lot of time with her nose in books, and derives her style, such as it is, from other sources -- most notably, and unforgivably, William Styron's """"Sophie's Choice,"""" from which she shamelessly pilfers the very specific dynamics of that novel's central ill-fated love triangle, around which all else revolves. Gruen's Nathan is an equestrian director named August (interesting to note there are six letters in each name), and he's a Jewish paranoid schizophrenic. When Gruen's protoganist -- surprise! a young, precocious, naive but quickly maturing lover-boy bred from earnest all-American stock -- finds himself caught between the couple (Sophie is renamed Marlena here), all hell breaks loose (""""all hell breaks loose"""" incidentally is a cliched phrase that appears several times throughout the book -- consider my usage a wry homage).Do yourself a favor and buy the original, not the infantile copy.""

"""I'm only a third of the way through, and bored of the contrivance of the characters. I'm particularly bored of seeing the world (past and present) only through Jacob's eyes, and he seems to have non-curious eyes like a camera rather than as a real person with feelings and understanding. The odd sexual references seem very juvenile, voyeuristic and very off-putting. I'm seeing reviews that my disbelief in the narrator's voice is felt by others, and am also seeing that """"it starts off strongly, but then it lost me"""". If the last half isn't as good as the first half, and I don't like the first half, then I'm wondering whether I should continue. Very disappointed.

"""Sometimes, a reader's expectations can greatly influence how she or he views a book.  With a name like """"Water for Elephants"""", and a historical background as interesting as the Great Depression, I had expected to read a book about the difficulties of the circus life and how the historical backdrop influenced these characters' lives.  What I got instead was a sentimental love story dressed in the glitz of a historical novel, a slightly better-written version of a Nicholas Sparks novel.At the start of the book, the circus has just come to town; and that effectively got our querulous 93-year-old narrator to start reminiscing about the good old days when he used to travel with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth as a veterinarian.  As it turned out, 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski was one exam away from getting his veterinarian's degree from Cornell when both of his parents were killed in an automobile accident.  After having handled all of his parents' affairs, and after having found out that he's now virtually penniless, the grief-stricken young man walked out of his class room and hopped on the first train that crossed his path, a train that turned out to be the circus train owned by a ruthless circus owner, Big Al.  For the next 3 1/2 months, Jacob travelled with the circus as a veterinarian, taking care of the animals in the manegerie during the day and traveling from city to city by night.  It was also during this time that he met Marlena, the cricus performer who turned out to be the love of his life, and her cruel but charismatic husband, August.  The three soon developed the kind of complicated relationship that any romance reader worth his/her salt will know how it's going to turn out.The greatest strenght of this book definitely lies in the author's portrayl of circus life as they were in the early 1930's.  With Big Al, August, and Walter the midget - the author has assembled a memorable cast of secondary characters that the readers will either love to hate or root for.  Walter, in particular, turns out to be a character with much more depth than initially meets the eye, and how his relationship with Jacob evolved and developed was one of the highlights of the book.  Equally interesting was Jacob's interactions with Rosie, a mischievous elephant that ended up being the catalyst for a key event that will change Jacob's life.  I've never been a fan of the circus, but reading about Rosie's antics made me want to grab a handful of peanuts and head to the zoo.Regrettably, our main protagonists in the featured love story aren't nearly as interesting as the secondary or even the animal characters in the book.  Jacob, in particular, has about as much personality as a gnat. Throughout the book, he was grouchy as a 93-year-old, and whiny and ineffectual as a 23-year-old.  Some of the atrocities committed against the members of the circus - all in the name of survival and profit - is heartbreaking.  And yet, other than to rant and spend time sulking and moping around in his stockcart, Jacob was useless when it comes to helping his friends or even taking fate into his own hands.  Ultimately, his life turned out the way he wanted it to not because of any initiative on his part, but pure luck.  Since the book was told in first person from Jacob's point of view, the character of Marlena was even more under-developed than Jacob.  All we know is that she's this beautiful girl in pink sequin that caught Jacob's eye the day he joined the circus and from then on he was lost. There certainly wasn't enough interaction between the two to make their romance remotely convincing.  And for a book whose central theme is the great forbidden romance between two people who met at the wrong time, this is a great failure.So, in summation, if you are expecting to read a meaty historical that provides insight to what the circus life was like back during the 1930's, skip the book.  If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks and looking for a sentimental love story to tide you over until his next publication, this may just be your cup of tea.""

"""I read Water for Elephants hoping for an epic love story set in the traveling circus, but instead I found myself covered in the muck of vividly lewd details and unbelievable relationships.  The love story is non-existent.  The two main characters only seem to come together out of a desire to escape the ugliness and cruelty of the situations they have found themselves in.  I never believed it.While I found the ending vaguely satisfying, most of the plot felt contrived and unrealistic, particularly for a book that was extensively researched for detail.  I did believe most of the more peculiar details, but, when strung together, these details didn't make a very cohesive or believable story. Ultimately, I found the book disappointing, overly lascivious, and poorly crafted from beginning to end.""

I cannot believe there has been such a fuss about this book and that someone was foolish enough to make it into a film.  Now that will be a real flop!  If I ever see this author's name again I will move away from it as quickly as I am able.  This was just a terrible book.""
"
"""I thought this was an interesting read until the author decided to label the villian of the piece as a paranoid schizophrenic.  August was cruel, sadistic and had violent mood swings.  None of these are symptoms of schizophrenia.  He did not hear voices, have complicated delusions, or an inability to keep touch with reality.  Unlike most unmedicated schizophenics, August had no trouble  thinking rationally or logically, on the contrary, he was in charge of a large section of the circus and exhibited fine organizational skills!The writer could simply have portrayed her character, August, as a jealous, violent man but instead she chose to advance the false stigma that people with schizophrenia are horribly cruel and violent or that they have a """"split"""" personality. If only Gruen had researched psychiatry as well as she had the circus.I work with people who suffer from this disease.  While, without medication the patients delusions might possibly, rarely, lead them to do something violent, it's usually in relationship to fear associated with a delusion -- thinking a person is really an alien from outerspace, for example.  Never the sort of cold-blooded violence August engaged in.  August always knew exactly who or what he was hurting.When medicated, people with schizophrenia are actually less likely to commit violent acts than the general population.It's truly a shame when a popular book spreads stigma in this manner, the negative ripple effects go on and on.""

The shifts back and forth in time were distracting and superfluous. I felt manipulated by the fantastically sentimental ending, but still, it made me smile.""

"""As I have stated before, one of my MANY quirks is that I must read a book before I watch the movie. When I read in Entertainment Weekly the Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison would be starring in the film adaptation of Water for Elephants, I knew that I had to pick it up. I rarely pay full price for a book. However, this one had such rave reviews that I couldn't help myself. Still, it sat on my bookcase until this week when I promised to read it before the opening of the movie. Honestly, I was greatly disappointed.Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski who is so distraught after his parents' deaths that he runs away with the circus. He leaves between his education at Cornell University and his future as a veterinarian. Fortunately, his study of veterinary medicine helps him land a job as the circus' vet. While touring with the circus he meets a number of characters from a red haired midget clown, to an old circus worker who is struck with """"jake walk"""" (a condition brought on by drinking tainted whiskey). Jacob soon discovers that life on the road is beyond trying. When an elephant is brought on as part of the show, Jacob finds himself torn between his job as a compassionate vet and the rules of the circus. This causes Jacob to bump heads with his boss, August, who is beyond temperamental and at times masochistic. To complicate matters, Jacob is in love with the lead actress of the show, Malena, who just happens to be August's wife.While the subject matter of the circus would seem to be incredibly interesting, this novel was boring from start to finish. The entire plot was cliched, the relationships were shallow, and the characters were without depth. From the first chapter, I knew the exact path that the novel was going to take. Every time I thought to put the book down, I convinced myself to give it one more chance. It was after all a bestseller, therefore, I thought it would get better. It never did. If anything, it got worse as every cliche was reinforced. The only twist came at the very end and was so absurd I had to re-read the last few pages three times over to make sure that I read it correctly. A book is only as good as its character development but in this novel there is no development. Though Jacob attempts to mature, he can't seem to figure out what his priorities are. Incidentally, neither can Gruen for she has Jacob bemoan his conflicting emotions between his love for Marlena and his feelings towards animal abuse. Fortunately for Jacob, the animals take their fate into their own hands which relieves Jacob of having to develop. I hope, for the box office's sake, that the movie fails to resemble the book. Either way, I will not be the first in line at the theater.""

The circus story (featuring young Jacob) was much better, but all it has is plot--characters don't really develop, writing is passable but not skilled.""

I don't regret it.""

"Gruen writes like a woman who is trying to sound like a man.  Her word choice and syntax did not ring true and unfortunately the method cost her some in credibility.  The book was nothing to write home about and certainly did not rank with anything by Erik Larson. The high ratings from other reviewers are puzzling.  The reviews about the movie seem to more accurately reflect the quality of the book.

"""""""Water for Elephants"""" was the last Book Club selection I read, and It was not my choice. Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.  This is one book that I feel I wasted far too much time on.

"
"""Not once while reading this book was I emotionally hooked -- unless you count my anger at the author. For all Gruen's indepth research into circus life of the 1930s, the atmosphere of the narrative felt wrong. The dialogue sounded far too contemporary and the stage directions -- """"I looked out the window""""; """"He moved his jaw before answering""""; """"I looked steadily at her then looked away""""; and the dramatic """"in the distance I heard the sound of a camel"""" -- were intrusive. Add to that the constant  cutting back and forth from young-buck Jacob to retirment-home Jacob and you feel not that you're immersed in another world, but rather reading the script of a touching Hallmark Theater production.The characters are from central casting: the good hearted whore, the tyrannical boss, the crazy husband and his sweet but long-suffering wife. And the noble hero. Young and bereft of family, Jacob stumbles into circus life and is hired as a vet. He is painted as the champion of the small and weak, regardless of sex or species, always wanting to do good and right. And yet, at the moment when his friends need him most, he's gone, taking their only means of protection, a knife, with him. And the elephant for whom he professes deep affection he leaves to the hands of a crazed maniac, to be beaten not once but twice, and our hero does nothing about it. How can we possibly cheer for him?Too bad the story wasn't told from the POV of a minor character named Greg. Greg shows up twice, first when he retrieves the elephant using what he knows she loves, booze. He shows up later ministering to her wounds from one of the beatings. He's speaking Polish to her, the language she understands. Why did we need Jacob? Sounds like we already had a vet, and a worthy hero, standing in the wings.""

"""This book was recommended by Amazon as I was buying another, it looked interesting from the cover, so I bought it.  I actually was surprised to find that the main character was a vet from Cornell--since I am a vet from Cornell, it really spiked my interest.  That was the high point of the read, a brief moment of pleasant expectation.  The book is not awful or unreadable, it's just shallow and facile.  An interview with the author explains that she became fascinated by old photos of the traveling circuses of the 1930, and wanted to write a book about them.  The setting seems authentic and compelling.  However, the characters are implausible and their interior lives are culturally anachronistic.  No one in this book seems remotely believable for the period--hasn't she read any Steinbeck?  The plot is like one of those traveling carny roller-coasters, where you hear each gear clunk loudly and laboriously into place.  The movie is likely to be ten times better than the book, because you won't have time to consider how unlikely the story development is.I think it is rather shoddy that Ms Gruen limited her careful research to only the subject that interested her--the circus.  How hard would it have been to consult an equine vet and come up with a plausible scenario for the equine illness that brings the main character on board the train?  How hard would it have been to learn the correct location to euthanize a horse with a gun?  How hard would it have been to figure out that Ithaca was an end of the line station, and a through circus train would not be """"passing by"""".  Couldn't she have gotten her character on the road without having him lose the family home to """"his Ivy League tuition""""--even the most cursory research would have revealed that Cornell Vet College was and is a state institution, highly subsidized in every respect.  Authenticity in all these details would not have detracted from the book.Most of the criticism of the book I've seen on line has been focused on what is perceived by some as gritty detail and others as gratuitous cruelty to animals.  I am a horse vet, and have devoted my life to horses.  I have no problem with feeding horse meat to the big cats.  But the total implausibility of having the inept assistant slaughter horses by slitting their throats is so ridiculous--the first poke with his dull knife, and even a horse drooping at death's door will be three fields away.  The average adult horse has 50 liters of blood--can you imagine how long it takes to pour out 50 soda bottles?  This is why people euthanize horses with bullets!  Why oh why couldn't she make it believable--there was certainly no shortage of true cruelty to animals to chronicle?I can only imagine that people love, love, love this book because it is easy to read (clear, straightforward writing, not challenging in the least) and puts 21st century TV movie sensibility into an interesting historical setting with a sappy happy ending.""

"""Full disclosure:  I read 'East of Eden' just prior to this book and after luxuriating in Steinbeck's prose for the last few weeks, the comparison seems almost unfair.  'Water for Elephants' has a novel premise but the execution left me cold.  Gruen's prose is expository and workmanlike, and lacks the artistry of the great authors.  Obviously she's found her audience - and I did enjoy the story so I can't complain too loudly - but with so many truly great, well-crafted pieces of fiction out there, why waste your time?  Life is short.  Try some other contemporary authors instead, like Jonathan Safran Foer, Khaled Hosseini or Nicole Krauss...  or Steinbeck, for that matter ;-)""

"""This book follows too closely the rule handed down by middle-school English teachers: make your verbs active. This rule becomes a problem when a writer makes the verb more active than it needs to be. When that happens, the prose gets breathless, and it actually ceases describing what is going on in the scene.In this book, people don't sit up; thy JERK upright onto their elbows. They don't turn their heads; they TWIST their heads. They don't walk by; they BREEZE by. A train doesn't round the bend; it EXPLODES around the bend. The overly active verbs make even the most mundane event feel exaggerated like a comic book scene.And one would think that having such active verbs would make adverbs unnecessary, because the verb would be doing all the work. Not so. For instance, in the span of less than one page, she uses coquettishly, coyly, demurely, gently, lasciviously, firmly, utterly, suddenly and violently (45-46).If readers are interested in a story to take them away to another time and place, this book might fit the bill.

It was an intriguing setting, with novel characters.  There.  Now onto the problems.The whole storyline felt distinctly soap-opera-ish, due in part to the dialogue and the shallow writing.  The characters had no depth whatsoever, very similarly written to Dan Brown or John Grisham's endless recycled characters.  Looking back on those books (I'll bet you've read more than one from each author, haven't you?  Come on, admit it), do you remember the characters themselves as distinctive?  No -- they were two-dimensional cutouts caught up in dramatic plots.  This is the exact same thing.  E.g. excerpt: """"She presses her face to my chest. 'Oh, Jacob--what are we going to do?' """"Which brings me to my next criticism: the dialogue comes across as very contrived and Grisham-ish.  Lots of people saying the listener's name.  LOTS of it.  Small nitpick, but it's one of those things that just doesn't ring true.Example:  """"Come on, Jacob"""" says Earl, taking hold of my upper arm. """"The boss wants you to move along"""".""""Give me just a second, Earl,"""" I say.My other criticism, which I haven't seen mentioned here, was the distinctly modern and  politically correct sensibilities of the protagonist(s) which came through somewhat anachronistically.  E.g., protagonist Jacob is dramatically indignant at the husband who beat his wife.  It was just too cartoon-characterish to me, too black and white.  Good guy, who has the delicate sensibility to be incensed at the injustices he sees around him; and the bad guys: wife beater and profit-monger.This could EASILY be adapted to a Disney movie.  Easily.  If you want a read that is thought provoking and that will stay with you for awhile, skip this one.  If you want a beach read, yeah, go ahead, I'll give it beach-read status.""

"""I remember when Cecil B. Demille directed a behemoth circus film called """"The Greatest Show On Earth"""" in the early 50's.  It had such spectacle, and what a star-studded cast headed by the great Jimmy Stewart, Cornel Wilde, Betty Hutton...it was, just, well, awful.  Yes, AWFUL.  And ya know, Hollywood decided to give this giant piece of piffle the year's BEST PICTURE Oscar.  I mean, it really makes you wonder why people (uh, powerful people, that is), go to the trouble of praising something that's not worth the price of admission.  Could it be....to make the film more profitable???  Could it be....money, money, and hopefully more money????  To gush and fawn over something so abysmal, luring the public into conforming to the propogandic publicity, that it finally becomes a pseudo-masterpiece, not to be missed?Know what I mean?Because if you don't, then borrow (DON""""T BUY!!), Sara Gruen's Best-selling monkey-poop called """"Water For Elephants"""".  This is a book that may give the beginning writer hope and much needed optimism.  Repeat after me....""""If Sara Gruen can be a published writer, then I can be a published writer"""".  It's so easy you don't even have to develope characters to any great extent, as long as you have a skeletal outline of your story, just scribble it down and then decorate with some tacky sex so it doesn't fall into the children's market.  Make sure the story is narrated too, but make sure it's just about as pretentious a narration as you can dream up.  Then populate the text with various freaky deaky characters and situations....like animal torture and alcoholism.  Then let the 'big boys' market it for you and wait for the film, that will hopefully have an all-female cast.  I mean, who cares?""

"""The books feels like the author was writing it while she was running on the treadmill, sometimes things speed up so quickly you can tell the author just got really sick of the segment and wanted to move on with the storyline. It renders the main romance somewhat rushed and insincere, at least that's how I felt. Characters who have known each other for a very short time share passion and requited love for one another, vowing to be together forever when one of whom is still married.Some details like the villain being Jewish are completely impertinent to the story but makes you why exactly the author did that. The protagonist is lovable and portrayed in very positive light throughout the novel, but his actions are just as villainous and psychotic. At one point where the protagonist gets really jealous he climbs on the roof of a moving train while carrying a knife in his mouth, intending to kill the villain in a very really Indiana Joneseque segment that makes you giggle at how superficial the author's line of thought was.Without revealing too much, it's very close to Moulin Rouge, only without the interest, tempestuous music and theatricality. If you enjoy sappy romance novels you'll like it.""

These two kept letting the sicko torture poor Rosie - I was disgusted how repetitive this scene became.Too bad the main characters couldn't have been Earl, who had to deal with these three - Greg, who should have been the veterinarian, and Walter, who was the only one with sense enough to recognize an evil sadist.

"""I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially after seeing the previews for the upcoming movie.  I must say that it is one of the worst books I have ever read and I have been an avid reader my entire life.  I couldn't relate or get attached to the main character, Jacob, except at certain points when he was elderly.  I actually felt very embarrassed for the author while reading the many squalor erotica scenes that did nothing to help me connect or care for any of the characters.  I was expecting a heartfelt romance, but the characters, including the love interest, Marlena, are so one dimensional that I found the whole thing absurd and unbelievable.  I kept trying to get into it and hoped it would get better as it went along, but no such luck.  If you must read it, try to borrow it instead of buying or see if you can pick up a cheap copy at a thrift store.  Better yet, spend your time reading something with a convincing story and engaging characters instead.""

"""For months, everytime I was in a bookstore - I found that I would gravitate toward this book, read the back and place it back on the shelf.  I should have listened to my instinct.  After many positive recommendations from friends and reading the reviews, I relunctantly check the book out at the local library.  I started reading with an open mind.  After about 200 pages, I phone my friend to ask her if I was missing something, because I just didn't care of the story and I couldn't seem to find a connection with any of the characters.  At this point, she instructed me to stop reading - """"because of you don't like it now, there isn't anything earth shattering that will happen that will make you change your mind.""""  I didn't listen, and she was right.""

"""I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to """"run away"""" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.""

"""-Juvenile and disney plot.-faulty and unrealistic details.-Uninteresting and underdeveloped characters.-Premature professions of love.Basically, this book reads like a typical Hollywood movie. This is unfortunate, but it is representative of a new class of novelists who are more influenced by movies' depiction of culture, rather than the actual culture itself. Minus all the R-rated stuff, this is nothing more than a whimsical book for adolescents. Once again an underwhelming and lazy manifestation of a great concept.""

"""Actually, come to think of it, my time would have been better spent staring at an hourglass.  This book was a soap opera in print.  The characters were mostly stereotypical, ergo predictable.  I don't think giving the ending away in the prologue was such a great idea, because I spent the next 330+ pages waiting for something (anything!) to happen in that vein.  Instead I found myself wading through pages of the author describing events such as tent raising, etc..  The romantic scenes were very campy.  During the first several chapters when the book's format became aparent, I thought it was very fascinating to have the elder scenes interspersed with the circus scenes.  It turns out that they didn't add much to the story, or even make me want to keep reading.  The writing in the elder scenes was amusing, and soon those chapters became my reward for reading the cirucs chapters.  The ending was perhaps the most aggravating aspect of this book.  Something about Gruen's description of circus life and all its attendant characters makes me think it highly unlikely that a modern-day cirucs manager would embrace a decrepit old man and rescue him from life at the rest home.  Maybe it was all those descriptions of redlighting we were given...I'm not sure.  All said, I enjoyed Gruen's writing style, but I would have enjoyed it much more telling a story with some substance.""

"""Characters were constantly doing things that just didn't make any sense.  His parents are both killed in a tragic accident a week before his finals, and his professors do NOTHING to give him the benefit of the doubt on his exams?  Were incompletes a complete unknown in this time period?  (There's a lot more, but I'm trying to block it out....)  The main character himself seems to have virtually no inner life except a vague desire to get laid.  At one point he says he's interested in animals, but there sure no evidence of this.The entire first half of the book is exposition about circus life, with a long segment of gratuitous titillation thrown in.  I've got nothing against &#34;gritty&#34; and &#34;true to life&#34;.  However, I have no tolerance for scenes that are so obviously there only to sell the book as soft porn to an audience that wouldn't know literature if it hit them in the face.Characters are less 3-D than cardboard cut outs.  My dad's vague recollections of a circus coming to town when he was a kid in this time period were way more riveting.  At least they involved actual people, with real human motivations -- not characters who move from point A to B only because the author's outline said the plot had to move there.And present tense?  Throughout the entire book?  That's a device that should have been discarded in high school.  It does nothing but make me snicker at the author's obvious lack of writing talent.I had heard a rumor that this book was written as a NaNoWriMo project, and I can certainly believe it.  It seems to have been dashed off from a previously constructed outline, without any regard for building up characters and then modifying the plot if it made more sense for their motivations.  The present tense writing style is another give away that this was written in a rush and barely revised.  And the plonking in of vocabulary and &#34;facts&#34; willy-nilly -- stopping what little story there is in mid-stream -- kind of screams &#34;first draft&#34; all the way through.""

"""I read this book a while back and I must agree with every 1,2 stars reviewer out there it is Overrated, plain and simple. I know a lot of people are interested in reading this book because of the recent Major Motion Picture starring Rob Pat and Reese Witherspoon.Oh, Well the premise of the story is quite interesting, an almost college graduate who runs away after his parents tragic death (nope this is not a spoiler it's in the back cover) only to join a traveling circus where he goes from a stable boy to the circus vet in a course of (well less than a year), and falls in love with a married showgirl named Marlena who is suffering under her abusive husband August (who is described as being schizophrenia but every psychologist will tell you he's just an aggressive, controlling jerk with anger management problems).So, this book has all the elements possible to make it a good read, Adventure, Romance, Drama, and forbidden love Blah Blah Blah !Adventure, Hardly ! Action (Well apart from the few scenes of hopping in and out of trains there's hardly any to count), Romance & Forbidden love ? (the romance element although seems to sum up a big part of the story even bigger than the circus is so contrived, lacking and unrealistic. The characters hardly hold a conversation to make us believe they belong together, I didn't care if Marlena and Jacob separated for life ! Actually I found myself hoping they would just to spice up the book from its predictable ultimate boring ending and I'm a person who loves happy endings) Circus Life ? Well, Yeah its there all right but the writing doesn't allow it to come to life. I never felt transported to the 193os, I never felt that I was in a circus. The descriptions were unfortunately very flat.The characters are the biggest disappointment in the book. They are two-dimensional at best as well as stereotypical. The Good guys are innocent, nice and bearing all the sufferings of the world on their shoulders and the bad guys are greedy jerks and a$$holes who only care about profit and the $$$ money !Some people were complaining about the Over the top sex scenes, Ahh, O.K ! I'm used to reading romance books heavy on sex scenes and this one doesn't even come close. I don't mind sex in books as long as there is a reason to it and as long as it is beautifully written. In here the characters are just flat out boring that they make sex and murder boring.Obviously none of them is sympathetic even Jacob who just lost his parents, we never get insight into his soul. We never knew for sure why or how was he driven by depression and shock after his parents death to leave all his life behind him and join a circus, we never even know how he recovered from the lost of his parents because he never show any signs of being sad or depressed. Marlena on the other hand, well she is in an abusive relationship so its O.K that she cheats on her husband with Jacob. It would've been rather interesting if her husband was actually a good man but she fell out of love with him and ran away with Jacob leaving the circus. Now that would've been a better conclusion !This book/author does the fatal mistake of telling instead of showing. We are told that this and that happens but we are never shown and therefore never transported. I give it 2 stars for entertainment value and because it was a fairly easy/fast paced book to read. However, other than that maybe I was expecting too much but this book is overhyped and frankly way overrated.""

I started trying to use white out to cover the offensive items.  I quickly realized that would include a great deal of the book.  I decided I didn't want to fill my mind with such things and stopped reading.  This book went directly into the recycle bin rather than being donated to a thrift store.

"""*****Spoilers Below*****""""Water For Elephants"""" tells the story of a poor orphan who joins the circus, becomes a hero, and wins the girl. The end. There. I've saved you 331 pages of familiar characters, melodrama, mediocre writing, and (if you're like me) 5 subways rides to and from work when you could be reading something else.Everything about this book is familiar: The plucky naive hero whose courage glides him to be savvy, but never jaded, confident, but not cocky; the fainting heroine; the surly, misunderstood clown who's really a kind-hearted soul underneat the makeup; the evil husband; the homey black nurse; the evil ring master whose employees are worth only what they bring in; the wise elephant; the lusty wenches; the migrant worker with a troubled past who says things like """"I don't rightly know"""" and """"reckon"""" and whole lot.All the characters were caricatures and I knew EVERYTHING that was going to happen about 100 pages into the book. From Marlena getting preggers (seriously: she's married to her husband for 4 years, sleeps with Jacob and his magic sperm ONCE and gets knocked up? How conveniant.), to the elephant speaking Polish (and killing August), to Walter coming around, etc. The good all end happily, the bad unhappily. The reader is even assured that the child is Jacob's and Marlena never gets fat: just in case you thought SOMETHING might go wrong! One thing I DIDN'T call 100 pages in was a 93 year old running off to join the circus. Know why? Because it's so ridiculous as to be impossible. I'm calling shenanigans.If the point was to realistically show how brutal circuses were, carry it to it's final conclusion: kill someone we like, not just the people who deserve it or animals without names. There was obviously a lot of (what must have been fascinating) research that went into this book. But even that was thrown in my face. Every time there was something I didn't understand, a character blatantly explained it right away rather than allowing me to just figure it out based on context clues and subtle writing.Overall, very soap-opera and melodramatic. If you read strictly for entertainment as a general rule, you'll probably like it. But popularity doesn't make it good.""

Truly a sad day for the literary world that something so crude  is considered 5 star worthly.  Coulld have been a wonderful story but the good was overwhelmed with vulgarity.  Too bad the author felt they had to  stoop to such disgusting levels to sell a book. I would be ashamed to put my name on something so dirty and offensive.

"""Jacob Jankowski's parents perfunctorily die in the opening of this mawkish melodrama, and Jacob drops out of vet school and runs away to join the circus, where he finds fast work as a veterinarian for a menagerie of anthropomorphic animals. Jacob also finds romance (not with the animals), adventure and a real Snidely Whiplash of a villain. Sara Gruen copies the manipulative, crowd-pleasing instincts of Stephen King and Ron Howard without displaying any of the personality seen in those men's work. She writes in a bland, transparent, easy-to-read prose of cliche, predictability and cheap sentiment. This is the kind of book you can read in a single afternoon without ever having to pause to think. It goes down like a bag of circus cotton candy, and it's about as nourishing. Strictly LCD entertainment. It's like """"Titanic"""" at the circus! It's like """"Seabiscuit"""" with an elephant! After reading one of the most ludicrous endings ever written in the history of populist claptrap, I think I'm being more than generous with my two stars. To the critics who overpraised """"Water for Elephants,"""" I offer this quote from the novel: """"Surely you can't all be happy with this ... this ... pap?""""""
"
"""Sara Gruen seems like a nice person. But this novel is total dreck. The structure reeks of baloney, the """"different"""" characters are written with the same bland voice, and the whole melodramatic mess never rises above laughable soap operatics. I'd never want to take enjoyment of this kind of thing away from anyone, but if you've not read it, I'm sure there are better books about the circus out there for you.""
"
"""It's written unbelievably well, the attention to detail is phenomenal ... but as someone who has to change the channel when an animal abuse case comes up ... I couldn't help feeling sick to stomach when the author went into detail about just how miserable these poor circus animals' existence was (and from doing a little research, still is in some ways). Having said that, I would still recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about circus life in the 20's, and the romance that enfolds is subtle and very beautiful as well.""
"
"""I bought this book because I thought it was about elephant hunting and I was very disappointed. The classic elephant hunting books """"Using Aircraft for Elephant Hunting"""" and """"Camouflage Blinds for Elephants"""" are both classics and are superb additions to the literature. Neither of those books deals with the tricky task of elephant hunting from boats or Jet Skis, and I've been waiting for the book that would finally address that obvious shortcoming. But, and I guess this might be a spoiler alert, this book doesn't seem at ALL to be about hunting elephants from the water! I read it very carefully, and even re-read whole sections, thinking that the author was setting the context that would play a role in the hunt. But on the second to last page I realized with horror and, literally, said out loud """"I don't think she's actually gonna kill this elephant... in fact I don't think she is planning on killing ANY elephants!"""" So if you are looking for a reference book on aquatic elephant hunting, or tactics on elephant removal from lakes and oceans, this is not the book for you. Plus, I think there was kissing in this book, and that has no place in contemporary elephant hunting.""
"
"I am half way through listening to this audio book and I'm not sure I can finish it.  It's not because it isn't a good story - because it is - but because the author describes far too many gratuitous sex scenes.  It is truly sad that Ms. Gruen cluttered the narrative with physical acts that have no connection to God's design for sex.
"
"""I couldn't finish the book I was so bored and I HATE leaving books unfinished. I didn't like the crudeness of it either, I just don't see why it was such a hit...... blah!""
"
"""I really didn't like this book very much.  In its favor, it's well researched, but the crudeness of the characters and animal cruelty turned me off.  I'm sure it's very accurate in its portrayal of the times, I'd just rather read something uplifting.  I read it based on a recommendation from a family member.  I, on the other hand, would not recommend it.""
"
"""I was excited to read this book, but I was disappointed in it. Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a """"90 or 93 year old man"""" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works. It is clear she did a lot of research on how the circuses worked, and it was nice to be able to picture those details.The book had so much potential. I wish it would have been better.""
"
"""So, this is the dreck that is passing for 'modern literature' these days? Honestly, after hearing some very good reviews about this books (actually, the reviews came to me via a co-worker who pressed a hand to her stomach, frowned and said, """"my daughter and I loved this book"""") I figured I would give it a try.The first sign that this was not going to wind up on my favorite book list was that after an hour or so of reading, I realized that I was more than 100 pages in. Normally when I'm reading, I pause occasionally to think, reflect, sympathize, emphasize, synthesize, etc, etc, etc. But alas, nothing deep and worthy of reflection was to be found. Nothing to stop me reading for a moment to think about what I'd just read. Not that I was expecting much, but I find myself more appreciative of a book, story, news article, movie or television show if it can make me think about at least something more than the words in front of my face. Again, not here. There was nothing to be found.Eventually, as the story continued and I learned more about Jacob and the circus, I can't say I was surprised when I found myself not caring one way or the other what was going to happen to him, or the rest of the circus bunch - there was nothing for me to connect myself to these characters with. If anything, the more I read, the more impressed I became with the author's ability to keep me so detached!In addition to the weak and utterly predictable story, (I mean, who didn't see that August was either bi-polar or a schizophrenic, that Marlena was going to get pregnant, or that Jacob's family wasn't going to show?), the dialogue comes out incredibly thin - to the point that I'm actually thinking that the author has never heard two people speak to one another. The dialogue comes across as forced and, for lack of a better term, soap opera-ish. I half expected to hear the dramatic soap opera bumper at the end of each chapter """"will Jacob get the girl, will August find out about their illicit love affair and will Rosie finally learn English? Tune in next chapter..""""But I digress. For everything I've stacked in the negative column about this book, there is one redeeming quality - and that is the story. I'm (somewhat) not ashamed to admit that I literally couldn't put this book down. It was like literary candy on a rainy day (actually a smoky day here in So-Cal). I picked up the book at 8am and set it down again around 10pm (having stopped for food, news updates, etc). Needless to say, I was disappointed.Overall, a good book for when you require some mindless entertainment - like sitting in an airport, or on death row.Finally, I was not impressed with the authors use of 'authentic circus lingo.' Apparently, she did some research. Well, I should hope so!""
"
"""It is actually a waste of time and money! The plot could be very good, but filled with sensual and detailed pornographic material it could do without!""
"
"""Considering the author never went to a circus before writing this book, and knocked it out with minimal research (""""circus people don't want to talk about their stories...""""), the results are as thin as hobo soup.  By the author's own account, she saw pictures of depression era circuses in a book and made up a story around them.  You never really learn about how a traveling circus worked, except cursory.  You never really learn about the railroad and life on the rails.  The end just drops off, too many threads unresolved.  Considering the potential behind the material, the book falls very short in many regards.  Sarah, fiction is not like """"Technical Writing"""", you need to spend the time make it believable and engaging.  This was a wasted opportunity to write a great story.""
"
"""I am truly baffled that so many folks rate this book 4 or 5 stars. I think the writing is cliched and weak. Although the circus has its share of salacious characters, the graphic, explicit sexual details are over the top and disgusting. If this book were to receive a movie rating system, I would give it an X. What has become of everyone that we accept, in the name of art, such explicit, kinky strange stuff, which, in my opinion, was gratuitous?Which brings me to this question, Why don't we have ratings on the back of every book, much like we have for movies. I would never in a million years allow my child, of any age under 18, read this.  I wish I had been warned ahead of time. If you have a graphic memory like mine, or are offended by anything perverse, save your time and money.""
"
"""I thought the story line was good and the plot kept me engaged.  I couldn't wait to see what happened next. A real page turner.  However....I think the author went overboard in some of the sexual scenes and explanations.  The story would have been just as good without the graphic content which makes this inappropriate for younger readers or families.  It is definitely an """"adults only"""" book.  Had it had signicantly less graphic sexual content, I would have rated it much higher.""
"
"What is all the hype about?  I was not emotionally involved with any of the characters.  I thought they were pretty cliched and predictable.  The whole thing is predictable.  There's one plot twist at the end--but its really not that mind blowing.  I feel totally underwhelmed and irritated that I stayed with it until the end.  There are better books to read on my precious Christmas Break.
"
"""This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have to admit I did not finish it. It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot. Don't waste your time.""
"
"""It appears as though I'm in the minority once again.  All of us are entitled to our own thoughts and opinions but for the life of me I can't understand the number of 5 star ratings given to this book.  I'm not even sure I feel good about giving it a two.I wanted to like the book.  Really.  Who doesn't love a cute, little, old man telling his story of the good ol' days?  But as endearing as the concept was, I couldn't get past the fact that I honestly didn't care that much about any of the characters.  Sorry but it had to be said.  The characters were flat, the story was more fantasy than fiction and worst of all, the whole thing felt quite familiar.  It was only later that it occured to me that this story was trying very hard to be Fried Green Tomatoes and/or Driving Miss Daisy; the difference is that I actually cared about the characters in those stories.  Frankly, Water for Elephants read more like a screenplay than a great novel.For my friends, I would suggest:If you want a story of reflection - The Green Mile, Driving Miss Daisy, Fried Green TomatoesIf you want a story about elephants - Hannah's DreamIf you want a story about a circus - well, I've got no idea.  :)Having said all of that, I would like to see the movie.  As stated before, this read like a screenplay -- bare bones, generally just waiting for someone to bring life to the characters and story.""
"
"""I purchased this book because it received great reviews from readers on amazon.com.  Truthfully, I was disappointed because I found the book rather dull.  There was very little action in the novel and I did not emphathize with any of the characters other than Jankowski in his 90s in the assisted living facility.  The insight provided into the """"circus world"""" of the Great Depression was interesting, but overall, I would not recommend the book.""
"
"""This book intrigued me because it is not something I'd normally be interested in reading. I was expecting to be """"moved""""--as so many reviewers had indicated. Instead, I was only """"moved"""" to flip the pages as quickly as possible to at least come to the surprise ending that was indicated in some reviews.The premise, the whole idea of a story set in a circus backdrop during the Depression, was fantastic. The story itself, in my opinion, failed. It failed for several reasons. The characters appeared to be no more than pawns for moving the story forward--they never made it beyond the cardboard cliche stage. Even Jacob, whose latter years were more endearing to read, was always seen from afar. We never really got in his head at all. He was totally unbelievable. Kid drops out of vet school and joins the circus and acts like a thirteen year old with thirteen year old dialogue.Which brings me to the dialogue in this book. Horrible! I caught myself laughing out loud, in disbelief at the cheezy sentences. And at one point I thought if I read """"uh"""" or """"um"""" one more time I was going to scream and toss the book in the trash.All that aside, if it was meant to be just a gaudy quick genre-type read, then it wasn't marketed that way. No one ever rose above the surface level, and I simply didn't buy it--the narrator, the girl, the speech during that era.The ending, well, it was okay. It meshed with the rest of the book.And Jacob, he seemed terribly stupid and sophomoric to be a lifetime vet who'd attended Cornell, etc. He was also grouchy and not likable, except when he finally got real about himself growing old. In fact, I came across this passage in ch. 16, """"...my brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges..."""" I thought YES!! This is what the story is really about: a man who once had keen senses and awareness, and traveled with a circus of all things, has come to the end of the """"show"""" and he is facing it and fearing it simultaneously. That was the story Gruen could've warmed my heart with instead of the basic, shallow, ridiculous story in Water for Elephants.""

"""I had the opportunity to meet Sara Gruen recently. She came to Fort Collins because her German Shephard needed open heart surgery, and while she was in town, she held a discussion/book signing at a local bookstore. Something she said struck me as rather odd. She said that she wanted the old circus photographs included in her novel because she didn't feel her readers would believe what she had written without the pictures. I'm not sure why she would feel this way, because as many reviewers have noted, her descriptions of the circus where the strongest parts of this novel.This was a book that I wanted to like better, but after all was said and done, it didn't leave much of an impression, other than her extensive research. The story, particularly the love story, was cliched, and the entire plot is predictable. Additionally, some parts of the story don't seem plausible. *SPOILER* For example, why would Jacob walk away from an Ivy League degree, needing only to complete a final exam? Yes, his parents were killed, but he knows that they made great sacrifices for him to attend Cornell. And what are the odds that when he jumps onto a passing train in the middle of the night, it just happens to be a circus train?In addition to the predictable plot, it was hard to relate to any of thecliched characters. I think it says a lot when the most interesting character in the book is Rosie the elephant. Jacob displays little or no character growth. And the book has a typical """"Hollywood"""" ending where the good guys get everything they want, even though they've had to sacrifice virtually nothing. And some of the dialogue in this book reads like a romance novel.That said, there are flashes of quality in this novel. The sections that take place inside the nursing home are well done, and in fact, old Jacob is a more interesting character than young Jacob.I just wish that the author had taken as much care in plotting her book and developing her characters as she did in doing her research.""

I generally don't read books for a history lesson, and I like to read mindless, fun things from time to time.I simply didn't think that this book was very well written at all. It was only about half a step above the writing that I found in that piece of garbage """"Twilight"""". (Yes, I did try to read it before I went around proclaiming that it was dumb!)

Characterized by terrible dialog and an absolutely plodding pace, I didn't care about what happened.  Very little depth was given to characters.  Given the possibilities of this story the author showed very little imagination. The book virtually ignores veterinary medicine which could have been a goldmine and goes into only one interesting ailment of horses. It looks to be written on an outline like a screenplay.  This happens on p10, a revealing flashback on p50, this happens on p75 and this happens on p200, then a couple of twists to keep the end interesting and a stuck-on hollywood ending.  (I mercifully skipped to the end and read the last couple chapters, then skimmed the rest to put it out of its misery)  I find it hard to understand what so many people loved about this book.  If it weren't for some cheesy and voyeristic sex scenes, including one of a masturbating dwarf, I would recommend it for 9-12 year olds but high school readers deserve much better in terms of taste, vocabulary and style.  The popularity of this book can only be a reflection of a lack of sophistication in its audience.""

"""I've decided I just can't finish this book. The main character is a 23-year old male, but c'mon - I just don't appreciate some of the details the author is having him describe and they are totally unnecessary to the story.

I'm not inherently opposed to romance novels, but this one has the guise of being so much more than that. The characters are nothing more than one-dimensional caricatures. If the book was merely marketed as being a transparent, sappy romance novel set within the confines of a traveling circus, fine. But it has the air of being somewhat of an intellectual read, with realistic characters, perhaps an accurate summation of what life really was like to live (and sure, love) on a circus in the early days, and it's none of those things. I not only didn't like the novel, I felt somewhat betrayed and offended by it. If I could have demanded that the author give me my money back, I would have.

Also the passages in which Jacob is 90 or 93 years old were beautifully written and very believable.The not-so-good:  The author often devoted long passages to the mundane and then just jumped over the parts of the story that a reader wants to spend time on (such as key dialogue between the main characters which would provide the reader with their back stories and develop a genuine love story)...which brings me to:The bad:  the characters are, for the most part, one-dimensional and the character dynamics and relationships are unrealized and unbelievable.

After having put it down on numerous occasions because I really could not get into the story and had better things to do, I determined to finish it recently so that I could return it to her saying I'd read it.  Considering all the wonderful literature out there, I have to say I felt cheated when I finally finished it.  When I read a book, I want the characters to be capable of many different emotions and states of mind, and I want to be transported by the beauty of the words within it.  As I read this book, I got neither of these.  I often had the sensation I was reading a middle school writing assignment.  The characters are flat and insipid, and the prose juvenile.  All were written with the same voice, which I suspect is the author's, since Jacob in particular spoke and felt distinctly as a woman might.  Marlena seemed to be able to do little more than cross her arms and tap her foot in annoyance. Even the villain of the story was written as a stereotype.  When I first started to read this book, I was at once reminded of Sophie's Choice, the story of a naive young man who befriends a damaged couple comprised of a mentally ill Jewish man and a Catholic woman.  The similarity ends there, because Styron's characters were richly painted with real emotion and angst and the emotions of Gruen's characters seem contrived at best, but I wonder if she wasn't trying to borrow from a truly great master when she chose them.""

I agree with another reviewer as to """"why the title.""""  Jacob is a vet school drop out and I rarely see references to """"water for elephants"""" in the book.  But I guess the publisher thought it was a catchy title to market and sell the book.  What's up with someone running out of their class and by chance finding himself on a traveling circus train?  Obviously a literary ploy (and not a very good one)to develop a story about the circus life in the early 20th century.

I spent the whole time I was reading it ranting to my husband about how bad it was, then threw it in the garbage when I was done.I am not an expert on the era, but I could never get past all the anachronisms. The dialogue in particular did not seem believable for its time. All the characters spoke with the same voice, and the author was completely unable to capture the voice of an older man. It is not enjoyable to read fiction when you do not experience any suspension of disbelief.

"""I picked this novel up in the airport as I was waiting to get on my flight to Orlando, mostly because it is coming out as a movie and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  That's my general rule after all.  And I was sorely disappointed.In this historical novel, Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, has left Vetrinary school at Cornell after suffering the loss of his parents, who have died in a tragic car accident.  He learns fairly quickly that his father, also a vet, was heavily in debt and actually died owing money.  So Jacob leaves school and his home and literally joins the circus. He travels cross country with the circus, acting as the show's vetrinarian and working under August, the head trainer and Uncle Al, the show's ringleader.  August is an interesting man, alternately charming and brutal.  He's also married to the beautiful Marlena, a performer, that Jacob forms a special bond with. This novel is about Jacob's relationship with Marlena, with the new elephant, Rosie and with Uncle Al.There are definitely several themes that are prevalent in this novel, which are super easy to pick out.  Water is for cleansing, for instance and the train tracks are for choosing a life path.I was not impressed by this book at all.  The themes were easy to spot and the ending was just as easy to spot.  The characters were shallow and one dimensional and I found myself annoyed with them more often than I was intrigued by them.

If you're looking for something other than a Harlequin Romance Novel, but with that type of subject then feel free to read this. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.""

"""This is a best seller and has been lauded by many as an accurate portrayal of circus life in the 1930s.  Perhaps this is true.I loved the narrator, an elderly gentleman who is living in a nursing home.  I related to his upsets about the way he is being treated and understood his desire to get himself to the circus which has pitched its tent across the street from the home.  I felt empathy of this old man and felt the several chapters relating to his present life were done well.Through his voice we learn his story in flashback and most of the book takes place in this circus in the 1920s when the old man was young.  As the fresh-faced new kid, he's a stereotype.  And so is the woman he falls in love with.  Problem is that she's married to the ringmaster.

"""""""Water for Elephants is fiction"""", but the author clearly did her research, and so it's solidly based on the sad realities of life for both humans and animals working in circuses during the Depression.  But sadly, animal circuses haven't changed much since that time.  Human workers may no longer be """"redlighted"""", but captive wild animals are still packed into buses or trains without heat in winter or air conditioning in summer, imprisoned in cages or chained up, forced to perform demeaning tricks for the public, and given generally substandard, if any, medical care and often, not enough nourishment.Gruen can tell a story, she has vivid characters, she presented the animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light, and I enjoyed the read.  But I have to say that to me, the happy ending of Jacob and Marlena finding employment with Ringling Brothers so they can bring Rosie, Bobo and the horses along with them is anything but.  Admittedly, for those times, it may have been the only option open to them, and there were few if any animal protection advocates out there exposing circuses like Ringling.  The truth is that Ringling Brothers has a long history of well-documented animal abuse, particularly of elephants, something Ms. Gruen never refers to in her novel--although, to her credit, she talks about the infamous, unbelievably cruel execution of Topsy by electrocution of none other than American paragon Thomas Edison.  It's also quite unrealistic that they would be able to keep an adult chimp as a pet, especially with five children of their own to care for and protect.  Chimps become quite intractable as adults; they're extremely strong, unpredictable and dangerous.I can't help thinking that the happy ending to a circus novel set in the 21st century would have Rosie sent to a place like The Elephant Sanctuary to spend her remaining life blissfully roaming hundreds of acres with other former circus and zoo elephants, and Bobo retiring to a wonderful sanctuary like Save the Chimps, where he would join a chimp family and have the closest thing to a normal life a captive ape can have.  And Jacob getting a job at a zoo so he can take Rosie along after his circus career is also not a very cheery outcome for me.  There's no question that zoo elephants lead short, painful, highly restricted lives, and many zoos are in the process of retiring their elephants to sanctuaries.Also, it's quite unbelievable to me that after Jacob witnessed so much brutality while working for circuses earlier in his life, he would want to join a circus again rather than live in a nursing home.  That speaks volumes about that nursing home!Lastly, I understand that the author considers herself an animal lover, but that can mean a lot of things, and I'm wondering exactly what her agenda was, writing this book.""

"""I just finished this book yesterday while on a flight across country.  I really disliked it.  I thought it started okay, but then it just became awful.With all apologies to the author, she seriously lacks skill in her writing, especially with her descriptions and dialogue.  The dialogue is painfully awkward and cheesy.  Characters' reactions are forced and awkward.  There were several times when I actually had to flip back and re-read sections because a character's reaction made no sense.  For example, in one scene, a friend of Jacob's has a medical problem, and a doctor comes to examine him.  Jacob had been told by another person in the circus what the exact diagnosis would be and nothing could be done.  Yet when the doctor says the same thing, Jacob is absolutely shocked.  It was weird.  And let's not even get into the dialogue between Marlena and Jacob which had me rolling my eyes.The characters are so underdeveloped that the reader is honestly kind of surprised when Marlena and Jacob fall in love, and it seems forced.  Marlena is boring and weak.  She's ALWAYS blushing and looking at the floor...which must be super sexy...or something.I probably would have given this book 2 stars if I hadn't read the ending.

"""I was expecting to love this book, and it is so bad that I have to put it down after reading about half of it because it is so poorly written. It seems like the story itself might be good, but I can't get past the writing. It is trite, cliche and obvious. I am aware at all times of what the author is trying to make me feel or think, and I am not persuaded. There is no subtlety. The characters' dialogue is like something out of a bad TV movie. Maybe in this case, the movie that is out now will actually turn out to be better than the book.The book seems to be written for the level of about a sixth grader, but the subject matter would be inappropriate for that age group. The author uses the word """"stare"""" about one time per page; sometimes twice. This is to let the reader know that something important has happened. """"August stares at me . . ."""",  """"I stare at him. . ."""" """"August stares at Silver Star . . """" """"I stare strait into his unblinking eyes..."""" """"Walter stares at me.."""". A few times people glare. And if they are not staring or glaring, they have their mouth open. And if the author gets really descriptive, they might have their jaw drop.The chapters about Jacob in his old age are cutesy at best. But they are dull as a sack of doorknobs.Many parts of the book are not believable. Sometimes you can make something unbelievable more real by realistic writing. But not here. For instance, the parents are killed off early in the story, and Jacob is described as an orphan. Is this to give a 21st century reader a reason to believe that a college student would throw his life away and go run off with the circus? But in the 1930s, a 23 year old would be considered an adult, and would have been emancipated from his parents at least by age 18, if not sooner. Children are orphaned, not 23 year olds. And we are supposed to believe that McGuinty gets all of the gals at the old folks home because he said that he used to work in the circus. There are many more implausible aspects of this book.I will call this author """"The Thomas Kincaid of Authors"""".""

"""Let me just preface this review by stating that I was extremely optimistic upon having the plot of this book described to me by a friend who recommended.  An elderly man approaching the end of his life in the crushing monotony of a nursing home reflects on his time spent as a veterinarian for a travelling circus?  Sounds like an idea rife with potential for an engaging plot, interesting characters, and brilliant prose.  Unfortunately,  I received none of the aforementioned attributes.  First and foremost, the plot of the book turned out to be one of the most contrived, infantile narratives I have ever read.  Man in veterinary school's parents are killed in car accident, grief-stricken, man leaves college and jumps first train.  Guess what...train is that of a travelling circus, and guess what else, they are lacking the seemingly critical position of veterinarian.  Man becomes veterinarian, befriends Wordsworth-reading dwarf(excuse me?), falls in love with star performer whose dapper, mustached husband is the book's villain, and a similarly predictable chain of events occurs which I will not divulge for those still entertaining the idea of reading this utter drivel.My other main complaint-yes, there are many- is the shoddy attempts at description that Gruen tries to pass off as prose.  A few examples of the author's lamentable descriptive powers are:""""After a moment, the elephant lifts her foot and holds it in front of her.  Greg kneels down and rubs some ointment in her armpit, right in front of her strange gray breast, which hangs down from her chest, like a woman's""""""""We held each other, like spider monkeys.""""""""I want her to melt into me, like butter on toast.  I want to absorb her and walk around for the rest of my days with her encased in my skin""""(creepy?)Yes, this book is easy to read, so if you get scared by big words, difficult prose, and long sentences, I suggest you pick this one up.  However if you don't mind reading something that is even remotely challenging or rewarding,  I suggest you avoid this novel in the same manner you would avoid an Ebola patient.""

My first college roommate was a real circus girl, and I can tell you that Sara Gruen did not even scratch the surface of circus life.It's a rare writer who can write well in the voice of the gender they are not, and Sara Gruen is not eligible for that club.  If I had not known for sure that a woman had written it, it wouldn't have been a difficult guess.The story is so melodramatic, it belongs among the most florid of historical romantic fiction, and that is not my cup of tea.  I had to force myself to complete this book.  I wish I hadn't.""
"
"""Although the story is quite intriguing and the juxtaposition of Jacob's life in a nursing home with his life as a young vet at the circus is a clever way to tell the story, the hardships that the animals endure are quite upsetting. I had to stop reading this book when August decided to take his anger out on Rosie, the elephant, because his wife who had never ridden an elephant was injured during Rosie's first performance, a performance for which neither one had trained. Circus trainer's used a bull hook to cause pain to the elephant so that it would do what they wanted it to do - I don't know the extent to which he tortured the elephant with the bull hook but I didn't want to find out.In terms of the writing style it is not the best. I believe the books' popularity may have more to do with the scenes in the nursing home which are much better written than those of the circus and touch the lives of many of us who have had to put our parents in or have visited these institutions.""

That was basically all there was to Marlena, a pretty girl in a bad situation.  Jacob was a bit of a weak lead, an ineffective hero to a story.  His problems were solved by luck, and I found that off putting because I find it more relate able when people work hard.  I was also shocked when it was revealed that the villain actually had a mental disorder.

It seemed like a very """"American"""" book- for people with short attention spans.All in all, characterization was thin; narrative was thin, and the whole experience of reading the novel did not transport me to another world.""

"""Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a book narrated by the memories of an old man in a nursing home flashing back to his life as a young vet on a travelling circus. Its based in the 1930s when the circus travelled by train into towns, to show off sideshow freaks and animal shows.What can I say about this book, it just didn&#8217;t grab me really and was a bit of a disappointment. The way it was written was very plain English and didn&#8217;t hold my attention or amuse me with the words. The talk about the animals and circus life was interesting and well researched. But the love story just wasn&#8217;t believable &#8211; the beautiful starlet falling for the pimply red headed virgin boy &#8211; nope don&#8217;t buy it sorry!I would recommend this book for animal lovers, young teens and the older generations as it has a mix from both sides of the story.""

"""I read this book on my kindle a week after watching the movie and I have to say I enjoyed the movie a lot more. They did a number of adaptations for the screenplay that made it work better. Like August was the owner in the movie, but in the book he wasn't but he was in charge of the animals and Uncle Al was the owner. At any rate, the movie was made for a PG-13 rating and though there were some mild situations and language, it was tolerable, vs. the book, where there was a lot of swearing and a few lewd descriptions that weren't necessary for the story in order for it to be a good one. If not for the cheesy sexual stuff and multiple F-bombs dropped, I would have enjoyed the book more. The story itself is quite good, but the delivery of it was lacking because of the language and overly-detailed sexual situations. So if I were to recommend one, I'd tell people to choose the movie over the book. It's less crude, and ultimately, a more satisfying experience. The story structure itself reminded me a lot of The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks.""

"
"""Having picked up on the positive buzz about this book, I couldn't wait to read it.  I'd imagined it would be somehow magical, enchanting - and I could not have been more incorrect in that assumption.I do give the book two stars, for two reasons - firstly, after telling what is, in essence, a pretty grim story, the author winds up on a positive note with a relatively satisfying conclusion; secondly, she uses old circus photographs to good effect.  More than once, when I turned the page at the end of a chapter, I was pleasingly rewarded by a photograph that illuminated what I'd just read about.Beyond that, however, what a disappointment!  I certainly get it that circus life during the Great Depression had its grim side, but if I'd known in advance how much the author would concentrate on that aspect of that world, I would not have read the book.  There is more than enough abuse to go around, both human-to-human, and even more distressingly, human-to-animal.  Not my idea of a transporting summer read!  Finding out through the author's notes that much of the violence toward animals is based on actual events does not make it any easier to read it.The book also fairly quicky reveals itself to be a plain old romance; the circus is ultimately just the backdrop to a watered down reworking of the main characters in SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  Great!  Another charming-yet-mentally-ill Jewish man who terrorizes his non-Jewish wife.  Only, this time, the story is told without the compelling use of history (the Jewishness of the husband in SOPHIE'S CHOICE reflected the themes inherent in a novel born out of horrifying WWII experience), and without the same elegance of language.  The writing style in WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is basic; it could certainly be a positive for many people that this book is, in that way, an easy read.More than anything else, I was dismayed as I read this book.  I wanted to know how it ended, so I did finish it, but after about the halfway point I read more with trepidation than I did with anything approaching pleasure.  Too bad, because lots of good elements are there, but they were never brought together in a way that worked for me on the page (having said all that, I'll add that I can see this story being picked up for a movie.  The cinematic elements are all in place - good & evil characters, colorful vintage backdrop, animals, retribution, etc, etc.  So, to Sara Gruen, if you get that, then I guess, good for you).""

"""After finishing a powerful and emotional novel like """"the Kite Runner"""" i started to read """"water for elephants"""". I am at chapter 8 and i am still hoping that this book will turn out to be better. Its written boring so far and the storyline is not making it any better. I know a lot of people will be shocked bout that comment, but i will continue reading and i hope that it will get better. So far its quite boring to me.UPDATE:Well i did finish this book and i dont know how this book got so many 5 star ratings?????? did i miss something? The whole story was BORING and I really didnt care to much for the main characters. The old man telling the story was a good Idea but at the end it was simply dissapointing.If you didint finish the book yet, then dont continue to read!From the first moment when he met August his wife we all knew what would happen.so that was not surprising at all.After reading and figuring out how august was acting up all the time it was also not hard to figure that he probbably had a mental problem. That was not surprising neither.I really wanted to like this book and i kept my word and finished it in the hope that it will get way better but .... no... this book is OVERRATED!""

"""I had to force myself to finish this and was continually disgusted with the animal cruelty. Maybe I should have stuck w/the gut instinct that I don't usually care for historical fiction? Gruen's insight into the minds of the aging is wonderful - she should have written something focusing on that. This book could also have been about 75 pages shorter and was painfully slow at times. The writing was not """"stellar"""" - I just don't see all the hype but for the millions that loved it I'm glad for you - just be prepared if you haven't read it to wince w/some of the scenes.""

"""MILD SPOILERS--I'm a little confused as to why this novel is classified as literary fiction, as it's lacking the strong character development and emotional complexity that most literary fiction strives for.  I'm aware I'm in the minority, but I can't honestly say I enjoyed this book.  It was very predictable, and the characters were wooden.  Marlena has zero depth--and Joseph isn't much better.  They fall in love, but it seems more like the affair happens because the author wrote it into the plot, not because these were two developed, real people whose minds and hearts shared something magical.  A few of the secondary characters have more detail, but they never go beyond superficial personality traits.The elephant is the absolute best part, and once I read that Gruen was inspired by old stories and photographs of real circus elephants and performers, I wished she'd gone ahead and written a non-fiction book so she could really delve into the struggle of the era and the horrible treatment of these animals.  She makes aspects of the circus interesting--in fact, that's why I kept reading even after I'd given up on the story having any real complexity or resonance, but the whole book is littered with anachronistic language that disturbs the realism she's aiming for.She's trying to get at some very deep issues (mental illness, extra-marital affairs, spousal abuse, the traumas of the Great Depression) but it's all very superficial.  She never quite digs deep enough to give these real complexity or power, so all of the characters have very obvious, stereotypical, predictably shallow reactions to these deep issues, and I was left feeling a bit like I was reading a kid's slightly juvenile interpretation of events.  Overall, disappointing and even a little simplistic.  The frame of Joseph in the old folks' home is the richest and most emotionally complicated part of the text--until the ending, which is utterly unrealistic and saccharine.""

"""This is quite an unusual book, but the story is told very well. I recommended it to friends.""

"""This book is an easy read - a straightforward, uncomplicated, simple story sprinkled with profanity, violence, animal cruelty, and sex.  I think if you like books about the downside of humanity then this book might interest you.  There's plenty of examples of human and animal exploitation.  The """"love story"""" aspect between Marlena and Jacob is lackluster at best.""
"
"""Where is the """"engaging,"""" """"delightful,"""" """"surprising"""" book described by the big names on this book's cover and in the first pages? I found a bland and childish story, with painfully one-dimensional characters I couldn't have cared less about. The profanity is unnecessary, as is the gratuitous sex (solo, duo, and trio). The only parts I thought were a bit interesting were the sections written from the point of view of the protagonist when he is in an old-age home. And even that got tiring, especially considering the ridiculous ending. I am only giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 because of those sections.""
"
"""The book is okay so far, but I'm very distracted by the horrible Kindle formatting.  I've never had a problem with a Kindle book before, but this one is full of gaps and spacing problems. Dialogue is separated by abnormally huge gaps, but author-intended spaces intended to denote a pause are the same gaps as the extraneous ones; in other words, the intentional spaces are lost in the shuffle.  This makes the book very hard to read and follow, since I'm never sure if it's a """"Kindle"""" gap or an """"author"""" gap.  This was very poorly digitized.  It almost makes the book unreadable because it is such a distraction.""

But if your looking for substance, sense, depth, or something to keep your attention beyond the first quarter or third of the story, look elsewhere.  I'm not big on """"summer reads"""" or """"romance"""" novels - if you are, you'll probably enjoy this.Also steer clear if you're not into senseless use of the """"F"""" word and random sex, and keep in mind it's also written at a very basic reading level 8th or 9th grade I think (although it's not content appropriate for those ages).Thank goodness I got it for free on the Kindle!""

"""For all the hype this gets I expected much better writing.  I cringed at the fact that the 'hero' of the story never stepped in to help the animal he loved so much when it was savagely beaten by the 'simon legree' type circus overseer.  It is only by the grace of the writer that the elephant didn't strike out at all of the obnoxious people who let the beatings occur!Some of the other reviews say much of what I thought about this book and the writing.  The characters are thin, not lovable, not anyone I root for ... with the one exception of the hero as an old man.  That is better done than any of the rest.The interaction of him with the nurse, Rosemary, is more real than that with Marlena.  I don't recommend this book for those who want good writing.  This is rather amateurish in so many ways.  I do admire that the author did the research... but her execution of the story and the story line leave a lot to be desired.  I felt the writing and plot itself wasn't much above that of a 'bodice ripper'.  I was disappointed.""
"
"I couldn't wait for this book to come out in paperback. I started reading it the moment it came in the mail. I was hopelessly dissapointed with the read. After each chapter I kept thinking something great would happen in the next and it never did. I felt no connection to the characters at all. The big surprise ending was totally unbelievable. The end wrapped up too quickly and neatly. The only thing interesting about the book was the imagery she used to describe the time period and the circus.  I have no idea why she chose that title because the elephant is not a major character at all. I did empathise with the older Jacob but found his decision in the end also unbelievable. Don't waste your time. This novel is nothing but a piece of fluff with no substance at all.

"""i cant believe how many people are in love with this book. i really, really wanted to like it, and kept waiting for it to be good, but it was so boring i could hardly even concentrate. like another reviewer said, the best part was the pictures, and that says alot. dont waste your time.""
"
"""Here are my problems with this book:1) Remove the sex and animal cruelty scenes, and it reads like a script from a bad Disney movie.2) The main character is shallow and throughout the book I had no idea what made him do the things he did. Why did he join the circus in the first place? Not once did he mention missing his dead parents, his home, school etc. Didn't he have any memories from his childhood, no worries about the future, no relatives, no friends? You never knew what he was about to do next, because his motives, thoughts and emotions were never dealt with, and that's probably because the writer had absolutely no idea how to do that properly.3) I get the feeling that some people liked this book simply because it was so easy to read even Bobo the monkey would get it, since it lacked any depth or complication in the script or the characters. Readers who rate this kind of books with 5 stars have obviously no idea what real literature is.4) The dialogue was poor, and so blatantly contemporary that it made me angry at the writer's lazyness of doing her research properly.5) It was so obvious that the writer was a woman that you could not get it out of your mind even for a minute.6) I'm no prude, but I'm sure images of the masturbating dwarf will be haunting me for a long time.7) Trust a good old disaster/great accident to get rid of the bad guys for you. That way you don't get to kill them yourself and become (gasp!) a bad guy yourself. I would be curious to see how the main character would get out of all that mess if the stampede had not happened.8) If you owned a circus and half a brain, would you hire a 90 year old cripple whith serious health problems who ran away from a nursing home and whom you have just met? Yeah, I didn't think so.9) I can't really recall the sex scenes, which means they we probably not as graphic as some readers suggest, and as for the animal cruelty parts of the novel, yes, they were (theoretically) gruesome but failed to disturb me or make a real impression on me because they were simply not convincing or believable, as was the rest of the book.""

The character's alone, (Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson) will redeem the satirical shallowness and cliched style simply with their screen presence.As with many of the comments already noted, this book is just not believable. I can totally comprehend how Rosie, an ginormous creature can pull a stake from the ground, okay... even sneek away for a drink or two or ten. But please, pulling the stake and splitting a skull in the midst of such chaos??? I think a more realistic death for him would have been...death by stampede!But more importantly (at least for me)...

If you are able to ignore those sorts of things, you will not find yourself feeling any kind of sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The characters do not develop over the course of the story, and seem only concerned with dabbling in vice. As a result, I was unable to identify with them.A portion of the story is written from the point of view of the main character in his old age. This writing is exceptional, and managed to keep me interested during the course of the book. Still, these marvelous little glimpses of author Sara Gruen's potential do not permit me to recommend this book to anybody. Avoid it.""
